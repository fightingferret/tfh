'3434, 100% repop?  not sure that is a good idea really..silence is quite

nice 

the mob uses the item in his attack code, will give him a death prog to trash the item to lower its reset.

##### mob stuff

'2301 still high, but should be doable now ;)

the essences should probably have no corpse.

'2309 uses dice rolls in dam_message and inflict, will get weird looking results

Along the Wall~
A dry and beaten bed of brown grass, long dead, recedes from growing

patches of desolate dirt.  Rising prominently from the lifeless field, a

black marble structure lies northward, wickedly grinning gargoyles

encircling its ebon roofline.  To the south, the arid plot ends abruptly

at the base of the earthen-hued stone of the walls.  East lies the corner

of the outer battlements, and west a small grove of ancient oaks.

Along the Wall~
The vast field of brown grass, long since dead, ends abruptly a handful

of inches from the black marble wall rising to the north, as though

loathe to touch its polished surface.  Leering gargoyles encircle the

roofline, silent sentinels over all they survey.  Southward, the outer

barrier of the compound, composed of earthen-hued stone, looms forever

skyward, untouched by time and weather.  A clump of towering oaks lies

westward and eastward lies the eastern stronghold wall.

Along the Wall~
Bordered by a dark marble wall to the north and an earthen-hued stone

barrier to the south, the field of dead and drying grass runs eastward to

the corner and westward toward the compound gates.  Wickedly grinning

gargoyles ring the roofline of the marble structure, staring outward with

wary, unblinking eyes.

Beneath the Golden Dome~
The destruction so rampant throughout the rest of the compound is barely

evident in this beautifully elegant foyer.  Doors of purest white marble

inlaid with gold open to the north, though many of the precious gemstones

which once adorned them have been pried away.  Plush carpets cushion your

steps, the sapphirene color only slightly stained with dirt and grime. 

Golden walls rise to a high, vaulted ceiling, the dome of which is

inscribed with intricate murals telling tales of glorious days all but

forgotten in the mists of time.  The elegant, flowing script so prominent

on the outside of the building covers the golden walls here as well, the

runes themselves a finer work of art than many paintings.  Arches carved

of gold mark entry to rooms to the east and west, while to the south

stretches a plush hallway.

doors marble~
A towering arch of gold forms the entrance to the north, the metal

beautifully carved with unicorns, dragons, and many other fantastic

creatures.  The doors themselves are formed of two immense slabs of solid

marble, as white as new-fallen snow.  An inlay of gold forms an elegant

script on the marble, though in several places, the gold has been

forcibly stripped away.  The doors are pitted in many places, and most of

the gemstones that once augmented the delicate filigree carvings have

been pried out, leaving only gaping holes.

~
E
murals ceiling dome~
The dome, appearing a work of perfection, molded from the finest gold and

jewels, makes lovely entry-piece.  Inlaid with colorful artworks and

fancy designs crafted of gold and marble, it is truly magnificient in

elaborate detail.  The different artworks crafted upon the vaulted dome tell

long forgotten stories with their thousands of words.

~
E
script~
The flowing script carved neatly into the entirety of every available

inch on the outside of the library, is seen in here also, appearing to be

of the same origin, as it appears very similiar in shape and form.  The

carvings have some meaning other than just a simple story it is presumed,

as the murals and artworks adorning the lovely features of this building

take care of that job.  No, this is something else.

Crushed Gravel Pathway -- Near a Pair of Towering Statues~
Standing in the open, damp air of the massive complex, a quick glance

around and the actual vastness contained within the inclosing walls is

pretty spectacular.  Seeing walls of twenty feet or more towering on

every side, blocking complete view of the outside world, creates a

feeling of contentedness that is also mixed with the feelings of dread

associated with claustrophobia; just this instance is your mind and soul

feeling confined within an enclosing, choking grip of darkness and evil. 

The crushed path that winds its way about this place breaks in all four

cardinal directions here, although anything north of here cannot be too

large, because the north wall is considerably close.  To the southeast is

a pair of towering black statues that seem to sort of glow red, like

emitting heat, but a blink or two and the visions dissipate.

1 north 1 east 1 south 1 west walls~
Towering on all sides, the confining walls seem very tall from this point. 

Providing little glimpse of the outside world, a tall tree or two may be

visible beyond them, but it is hard to tell if it is trees or not,

leaving only the sky as visible freedom.

~
E
towering black statues~
A few yards southeast of here, two meancing black statues rise from the

earth, crafted with every detail in mind.  Facial features or real detail

is hard to distinguish, but it is obvious that it is present to anyone

who has seen statues before.  At first glance, a soft red glow seems to

come from them, and the first thing you think of is heat, but after a

blink or two, the red glow does not seem to be there, questioning if it

ever was.

Along the Wall~
Here in the southeastern corner of the compound, walls lie to the south

and east.  Chiseled expertly into the eastern wall, a narrow stairway

leads directly to the top of the ramparts.  A creeping vine, the only

life among a field of dead or dying grass, edges its way up the

staircase, its claw-like protrusions digging into the walls for support.

Vast fields of dry, brown vegetation stretch both to the north and

westward back toward the crystalline gates.

long staircase carved eastern creeping vines~
Expertly crafted into the walls of the compound, the stairway rises

steeply to the ramparts.  Shallow risers and narrow treads make footing

difficult at best, and nearly impossible to wage a battle on.  A creeping

vine, deep green in color, has begun to lay claim to the abandoned steps,

its claw-like protrusions digging into the nearly non-existent seams of

the walls.

Along the Wall~
You stand in a field of dead grass sandwiched between an earthen-colored

wall and a wall of black marble, as dark as the midnight sky.  The only

color comes from a few green creeping vines that are slowly crawling

their way up the outer wall.  A row of gargoyles line the roof of the

building to the west, carved directly out of the silver viened black

marble.  The field of dead grass continues towards the corner of the

compound to the south and deeper into the stronghold to the north.

Along the Wall~
Large criss-crossing fissures permeate the earthen-colored outer wall of

the compound.  The wall has remained standing though it appears to have

taken a brutal pounding some time in the distant past.  The ramparts

appear to still be structurally sound though obviously much weaker here

than at any other point.  A large crater has destroyed part of the field

to the west leaving a gaping wound in the earth, resting within the exact

center is a heavy boulder.

criss-crossing fissures walls stone outer ramparts~
This portion of the earthen-colored outer walls shows stress fractures

across its entire surface.  While each of these are small, they hint that

some sort of powerful force was slammed against the wall here, perhaps

during some unknown seige on the compound.  The wall still seems sound

despite these minor cracks perhaps mainly due to the magical energy that

was used to create them.

E
crater gaping wound west heavy boulder~
This boulder looks as if it weighs several hundred pounds, testement to

this is the large crater that it now rests within.  Only a heavy seige

engine could have possibly tossed this size of a projectile over the

ramparts, this could also be the reasoning behind the damage to the

eastern wall.

Tower Foyer~
The entire room seems to be hollowed out of a single piece of ivory, burn

marks and blood causes the almost translucent stone to glow an evil

crimson in the ambient light.  A spiral stair, chipped and damaged, rises

up out of the floor, curving around itself as it travels to the ceiling. 

There is no support pillar for this structure, and the railings seem more

serpents coiling through the air than pieces of cold stone.  A dimly

glowing rune pulses angrily at about chest level, a malignant purple.

Courtyard - Before an Ivory Tower~
Pearlescent ivory walls now stained with soot, rise far into the sky,

seemingly without end from so close to the base.  Not a seam can be seen

in the tower's stone, but scratches and scorch marks reach roughly twenty

feet up its walls.  Above the darkened soot line, the alabaster tower

still rises unscathed.  The seamless construction gives the strong

impression that the whole of it was created through a great expenditure

of arcane power.  Looking closer, a dimly glowing rune pulses angrily at

about chest level, a malignant purple.

Courtyard - Before a Guildhall~
Great trees soar overhead, limbs outstretched but no longer clothed in

lush, green leaves.  Hazy sunlight attempts to filter through the bare

branches, but the courtyard still seems shrouded in shadows.  Once-fine

emrbroidered banners hang from the lower limbs of the trees, and flutter

silently in the chill wind.  The sound of sluggishly flowing water can be

heard to the east, an almost mournful chorus.  Glimpses of structures can

be seen through the trees in every direction, but at a great enough

distance to not disturb the courtyard.

The Guildhall~
Greasy black stains creep out into the center of the room, almost as if

someone had thoughtlessly scattered the coals of the fire onto the wood

of the floor.  The stone hearth completely dominates the west wall of the

room, sootstained but still intact.  An empty iron cookpot hangs from a

hook above the cold hearth, while several of the trestle tables have been

chopped into firewood-sized pieces, some stuffed into the hearth, some

scattered along the east side of the room.  Shattered glass litters the

bar, which is almost untouched except for several deep scratches.  There

is no evidence of the stools which must have stood before the bar, but

several of the benches have been thrown behind it.

Before a Quartz Gate~
You stand just inside of the large gates leading from the Training

Grounds complex.  The sheer size of the southern entrance is astounding,

drawing into question how the arch and its closure were created.  A pair

of crystalline doors, a milky quartz in color, bar passage through

the archway.  No hinges can be seen in the quartz doors, though there are

dark, nearly black smudges, on the outside surface.  In the distance,

less than a score of buildings rise up from the level landscape.  Of

differing designs, the structures all seem to be of the same skillful

craftsmanship.

[Cyndra] how come i keep finding out the name of thise area? :P

[Eliza] It is my understanding that the pc's learn the name of this area

from a mob, long before they ever reach the gates.  IMHO, using the name

isn't out of line.

Courtyard - Near a Temple~
An imposing structure of obsidian marble soars up into the empty eastern

sky.  Thinly veined with silver, the stone seems pulled out of the night

sky itself.  Once elegant arches, pillars, and flying buttresses now lie

broken and crumpled on the ground.  Remnants of a circular stained glass

window still gleam in dark jewel tones from the center of the facade, now

gaping holes diminishing its beauty.  Wickedly grinning gargoyles carved

from the same night-colored stone of the walls surround the gaping hole

filled with jagged pieces of stained glass.

arches pillars flying buttresses broken ground~
Shattered pieces of ebon marble lie strewn upon the ground at the base of

the temple.  The grass growing up around each piece gives the impression

that none of these pieces have been moved recently..  Curving edges on

the fragments of rubble speak of elegant stonework that once matched the

gaping wounds of broken stone high upon the front wall of the building.

remnants circular stained glass window center gaping hole~
Sunlight reflects oddly off of the slivers of stained glass still

clinging to the iron framework of the great circular window.  Myriad

colors in a darkened and twisted parody of a rainbow litter the ground

below the window, giving the impression of great intricacy in the

original pattern.

~
E
wickedly grinning gargoyle~
Shining black marble pulls away from gleaming silver teeth, cunningly

fashioned out of the stone to match the natural pattern of the gleaming

veins in the dark rock.  Eerily lifelike, the creature crouching high

above your head almost seems to be watching you with dark, evil eyes.

Inside the Temple~
Tarnished silver braziers lie toppled along the aisle, once the main

illumination for the temple's interior.  A single brazier stands near the

front of the room, feebly attempting to light the room alone.  Dark

pillars, once brilliant columns, their silver threads reflecting the

flickering light from the braziers now show marks of great neglect.  Cuts

and chips mar the pillars of marble ruining their value but not

diminishing the memory of their beauty.  Pews lie broken and shattered on

the floor, no longer facing the altar in the front of the room.  A dingy

white carpet, now no more than tattered remnants feebly attempts to flow

down the center aisle, converges with the threads of carpet covering the

raised dais at the center of the temple.  Broken remains of alabaster

candles fill tarnished candelabras along the far walls of the temples.

Taking more careful notice of the toppled braziers lining the aisle, you

E
dark pillars columns marble~
The four pillars supporting the second story of the temple are in a

serious state of disrepair.  The columns have been crafted out of a rare

black marble, silver threads running it in a pattern only nature could

create.  Great gashes have been sliced into the pillars, the marble

chipped near the beginning of each slash.

~
E
pews shattered wood~
The pews that once made two rows of seats have all been shattered and

hacked up into small pieces.  Judging by some of the larger pieces of the

pews, each must have been handcarved with extreme care and craftsmanship.

E
dingy white carpet tattered remnants aisle~
Flowing down the center aisle of the grand temple is the remnants of a

once fine carpet.  Moths, time, neglect and the uncaring step of an

inestimable number of feet have all but destroyed the carpet.  It is now

a dirty grey in color, and in a few places merely a few threads still

clinging together.

E
alabaster candles candelabras~
The alabaster candles that fill the candelabras which have been placed at

equal distances along the outer walls have all either been broken or

burned down to near nothing.  Similar to the rest of the room, they show

great neglect in their appearance.

The Altar to the Gods~
Many flickering shadows are cast by the strangely glowing blue flames

adorning small ivory candles set upon the altar.  Bent candelabras gleam

a dull metal at the edges of the room, with small grey pools of wax that

once were candles.  The blue light reflects oddly off of the silver

inlaid runes on the great stone that is the altar.  Each rune is

flawlessly formed of pure silver, and is the symbol of a god or goddess. 

None takes any precedence over any other, nor varies in anything other

than shape.  Strangely enough, the entire altar set-up appears to not

have been disturbed by the chaos that seems to have destroyed the temple

proper.

Stepping closer to the marble slab of the altar, you feel a shiver run

down your spine, as if this site was under close scrutiny.  Untouched and

perfectly polished, this altar to all gods of this realm seems almost

otherworldly.  Small ivory candles are topped with a vibrant blue flame

that never wavers, even in the chill wind that runs through the compound.

Chamber of the Pyramid~
Dark runes, dimly pulsing with an unworldly power, are carved into once

fine dark obsidian walls.  Cracks and blood stains now mar the once

perfect complexion of these glistening walls.  The burned out remains of

a single torch, held in a now tarnished and worthless mithril sconce

lends proof that this room was inhabited in the not so distant past.  A

stand fashioned into the shape of a dragons claw lies tipped over on its

side in the center of the room, shattered on the floor is the remains of

the crystalline pyramid.

Along the Wall~
The outer wall of the compound shows a great amount of damage, as does

the actual ground beneath your feet.  The battlements to the west still

reach their original towering heights though they now have great chunks

of rock shattered out of them.  A semi-circle of earth, completely devoid

of vegetation radiates out from the crumbling wall.  Small fragments of

black metal dot the barren landscape in odd clusters ending at about the

point where tracings of dead grass still remain on the rim of the circle.

Great damage is evidenced on the outer wall of the compound, chunks of

the wall have been seemingly blasted away.  Looking closer at the damage,

it is possible to conclude that the damage came from the outside and the

rock was blasted inward.  The wall still stands but sections of the rock

are now completly gone, though not so much that this area is indefensible.

This circle of black metal appears to be some sort of airborne delivered

shrapnal.  The vast majority of the fragments are buried with just pieces

of the metal showing through the earth.  Most likely they were somehow

lit on fire before being delivered as they are all scorched and covered

in a black dust.  The effect of such a tirade would have been extremly

deadly as evidenced by the complete and total lack of vegetation that

survived the area.

Before a Ruined Gate~
A small sapling has pushed its way up through the bed of fine gravel that

makes up a path leading out of the once useable gate to the east.  The

actual gate is crafted out of a milky quartz, though still mostly intact

the gateway is damaged beyond repair.  The earthen-colored wall appears

to have actually collapsed in on itself here slightly, a definitive dip

appears in the height of the wall above the quartz door.  The gravel

pathway leads away from the gate to the west, while fields stretch out to

both the north and south.

Spidery cracks abound on these mikly quartz colored gates, included in

The stone that makes up these seamless walls is an exacting color for the

magicks.

Crushed Gravel Pathway~
Crushed gravel creates an easy walking road beneath your feet.  Slicing

through the natural landscape, this crushed gravel looks almost as if it

were meant to be here, rather than added by mortal hands.  Remnants of a

short hedge runs along side the path to the north, standing between you

and a long line of barren limbed trees.  The path continues along to the

east towards a set of quartz gates in the compound wall and to the west,

deeper into the compound.

extend over the surrounding buildings and cast a great shade, creating a

Overgrown Dirt Path -- Beside the Western Wall~
The dirt path proceeds here, becoming a tad more narrow, and a bit

cleaner, like there is more traffic in this spot.  Prints in the ground

indicate small animals have probably been scurrying around here, no doubt

in search of food.  Looking south, a big wooden structure comes into

plain view, appearing rather dark.  A chilling breeze blows here,

carrying wistfully into the magnificient trees off to the west, blowing

their heavy branches roughly against the sky.  The wide row of very tall,

Overgrown Dirt Path -- Beside the Western Wall~
The path here starts to grow a bit more narrow as it winds south, and

more compact and hard beneath your feet.  The dirt seems to be a shade or

so lighter also.  Some flies buzz around a bit at the area, possibly a

dead carcass around or something.  Looking south, a good sized building

can be seen.  Back to the north, the path you are on winds a bit to the

east, following the walls of the complexly large compound.  To the west

the walls of the compound run parallel with the road, seeming quite grand

in the shadows of the tall trees standing before them.  The carefully

landscaped row of hedges runs a good distance along the eastern side of

the path here, south until it gets near the wooden structure standing on

the horizon.

1 south good sized building~
Probably large when closer, this building appears to be dark in color,

structure?

Standing immense, the walls of the compound around you look quite

confining and secure, especially in the shadows of the tall trees planted

around them.  The wall runs parallel with the road, which does not seem

that odd.  The trees sway gently as the calm winds blow them.

~
E
1 east hedges~
A dense row of hedges, all growing into each other to form one large wall

many feet wide, parallels the dirt road to the east.  Branches of thorns

and leaves twisting and curling around each other in a criss-cross maze

on the inside, takes full view on the east side of the path, blocking

anything past it.  The hedges continue northward until the west wall

begins its turn, where they appear to stop, and also extend south all the

way to the wooden structure.

Overgrown Dirt Path -- A Bend in the Western Wall~
The western walls of The Training Grounds seem to widen here, forcing the

path a bit more to the west.  Contrarily, the path is beginning to narrow

a bit, as it seems it stops at a building up ahead.  A few grasses grow

around the edges of the path, and the dirt on the path is quite smooth

and comfortable on the feet.  Back to the north, the road follows along

the path of the wall, curving eastward.  To the west the walls of the

compound vertex twice as it juts inward before heading back north again.

The west wall running parallel to the road, comes to a vertex here, and

Overgrown Dirt Path~
The path follows the wall here to the second perpendicular corner, where

it turns and heads north again.  The air here is a bit chilly, partly

because of the constant shade of the wall, but there is more to it than

that.  Rocks crunch underfoot a bit too loud.  Things appear very quiet, a

lacking of signs of life.  It appears there would be maybe insects or ants

here, but the the least foot print or anthill is non-existant. 

Continuing to the west, the path goes on for a small distance, before

hitting a second square angle back to the south.  To the north it

continues along the tall, looming wall.

The impending walls here cast a constant shadow on the path, making it

pleasantly cool, in a sense, but it is cooler than just shade.  It feels

almost cold, and the more dwelled upon, the colder it feels.  An

uncomfortable feeling of dread is presented, making senses seem to become

more aware and searching for some lurking evil.

The path follows the wall west, which is not that far, for the wall hits

can tell.

Crushed Gravel Pathway~
The gravel pathway stands cornered here.  On one front, three statues put

a wall of evil and pain in the air, almost visible, while on the opposite

side, the west and north walls get closer and closer, blocking vision and

passage in both directions.  The two statues southeast of here look very

black and surreal, and the one also southeast, but more east than the

previous pair, is strangest yet, appearing two-dimensional and almost

translucent.  The north gate, looking milky white from here, is visible a

few yards from here, stuck in the north wall that looks quite long and

intriguing.  The path follows west, jutting around a turn in the wall, to

follow the west wall south.

Seperated by some tufts of grass and dirt and a few yards, linked by low

The north and west walls of the compound meet not too far from here,

where it runs east along the northern wall, stopping at the

@emilky-white@n gate due north of here.

Straight north of here a small tread is a good sized gate, crafted of

what appears to be @emilky-white@n stone, but the distance and light from

The gate is recessed back in the north wall, keeping out unwanted

South of the Crystalline Gates~
You stand just inside of the large northern gate leading to the outside

of The Training Grounds complex.  The gate is not immense by any

standards, but instead is extremly wide, allowing for the passage of

large wagons.  A pair of crystalline doors, a milky quartz in color bars

passage through the gate.  The gates hang as if by magic, suspended as

they are within the hollowed out section of the wall.  Dark smudges

appear to cover the outside of the quartz doors, as evidenced by the

complete lack of light penetrating this partially transparent stone.

1 north crystalline gate quartz milky dark smuges transparent~
Standing only tall enough for a small ogre, the height of these

extravagant gates are by no means proceritous.  The width though, is a

considerable amount, especially in terms of proportion.  It is obvious

this is the entrace for large bands of travellers, or even wagons.  The

crystalline doors of the gate shimmer and sparkle like cat eyes in a sea

of milky quartz.  There seems to be no sign of hindges, or anything that

would be obvious as to how these doors hang or open, probably magical is

the best guess.  Dark smudges can be seen on the outside of the doors,

making light penetration absolutely none.  These doors are if anything,

quite spectacular.

Crushed Gravel Pathway -- Near a Pair of Towering Statues~
A full three-hundred and sixty degree turn reveals numerous surroundings,

all painted with dull colors of silence and pain.  The gravel path

underfoot is a mix of light gray stones, crushed by much use, along with

dry dirt of a slightly darker hue.  The grasses that grow in a clumps

here and there are lacking in chlorophyll and look a very pale green.  To

the southwest a ways, a large structure crafted of wood has long since

weathered, and although still appearing very dark, has lost its richness. 

The only presence of vivid color is in the form of the jet black statues

that lay to the northeast a few feet, the colors so pure and alive they

seem to pierce anything with their stern gaze.

Southwest a good walk lies a structure, probably two-story as it appears

at least twenty feet tall.  Its wood is very dark, quite strange looking

in fact, but weathering and rain has soaked and tugged the life out of

it, pulling it to the ground to be lost away in the slate soil.

A very shiny black, the statues laying to the northeast appear to be made

Crushed Gravel Pathway~
The path opens up here, junctioning at all sides.  Just north of here,

two statues crafted of black stand, looking over everything around them. 

No happiness or thoughts of good exist when looking upon them, but only

those of trouble or anger.  Contrasting their darkness though, is a

beautiful golden structure off to the east a bit, its healthy shine

reestablishing any thoughts of good that existed before gazing upon the

wicked figures to the north.  Southwest, the gravel path winds around a

building shaped of fine, dark wood, looking to be a two-story structure

full of more mysteries.

A Tiny Square Chamber~
Very dark walls of a thick grey metal surround at all sides, forming

perfect a rectangular prism.  The room is not very big, no more than a

human could fit in here, probably.  It was likely carved in the ground to

hold certain valuables, as it is very small and secretive, and only big

enough for someone to put something down here, and nothing more.  The

walls are very smooth and cold, and the room has a chilling, foreboading

Along the Ramparts~
Here in the southeastern corner of the ramparts, a guard would be able to

watch two directions at once for approaching enemies, both the eastern

and southern roads though distant are visible.  Chiseled into the inner

section of the wall, a narrow stairway leads directly down into the

courtyard, beside a dark marble building.  A few creeping vines are

evident, cresting the top of the staircase as they attempt to cover the

walls in its entirety.  The vines are yet another reminder that little

care has been taken to prevent the degradation of this majestic compound.

The narrow stairway descends sharply into the courtyard below.  The

From this distance it his hard to see much detail of the winding mountain

road.  It weaves its way between the great mountains disappearing out of

would be bottled necked in several locations, making this a highly

defensible location.

Even from here it is clear that the dark marble building would have been

The stone ramparts extend high enough an archer has a good sight on any

travellers within range of his bow, making the surrounding areas

black marble temple is clearly visible and is quite a lovely building. 

Looking out southward, the whole valley below the compound is visible, at

the base of the steep sides of the plateau.  The ramparts continue east

Along the Ramparts~
Silently flying over the walls of the compound, the flag of the cult of

Morkith acts as an eerie reminder that darkness has enshrouded this

compound.  The flaming eyes of the skull on the flag stare out over the

compound proper, seemingly coming to rest upon the black marble temple

that lies directly to the north within the stronghold.  Glancing out over

the walls of the compound, a sheer dropoff is evident just a short

distance off of the road leading up to the gates, the mountaintop curves

towards the outer wall acting as a defense for the whole structure. 

Evidently the stronghold was built in such a manner as to provide as

little ground outside the walls as possible no doubt in an effort to

thwart any attacks from normal means.

A field of rich ebony cloth forms the background of this banner; the only

decoration upon it is a fiery skull of crimson.  Golden embroidery

outlines the skull, giving the flames almost a life of thier own.  Hollow

eyes stare out over the compound, forever watching this place.

E
temple black~
Just beyond the embrace of the wall to the north lies an exquisite temple

of black marble.  The stone of which the building is made is flawless,

and seemingly crafted from one colossal block of marble, so fine is the

workmanship.  The surface of the marble is a deep, glossy ebony, shining

brilliantly in any light.

Guard Tower~
Hidden from view from the grounds outside the main compound walls, a

medium-sized guard tower offers some small respite from the weather for a

weary guard.  Open on both the east and west, the tower's sole purpose

appears to be warmth and shelter for anyone on guard duty on rainy or

cold nights.  A small fire pit is set into the southern section of the

wall, crafted in such as way to allow for a flame to burn to provide

warmth yet to completly hide any light from a person standing on the

ground below.  The courtyard below and to the north is visible allowing

one to see anybody entering or leaving any one of the compounds buildings. 

Obviously also visible is the small road that leads up to the compounds

gates, this being the only real direction an attack of any size could

stem from.

The courtyard below must once have been quite beautiful, however, the

many of the flowers and other plants which once added a hint of color and

elegance to the place are now withered and wilted with neglect.  Several

large buildings catch the eye.  among them a large, ebony marble temple

and a building which looks to be made of solid gold.

~
E
road~
Winding its way up the plateau is a small road of hard-packed earth. 

Dense, overgrown vegetation grows untended on either side of the pathway,

as if this way was not heavily traveled of late.  In several places, the

land itself is scorched for vast areas, and in others, piles of stone and

other miscellaneous rubble lie heaped beside the path.

Above the Crest~
A semi-circle of the same earthen-colored rock as the entirety of the

walls is visible to the south.  The half circle is the top portion of the

crest of the training grounds that overlooks both the southern gate and

the road leading up to the mounta This would be one of the main points of

defense of the stronghold should it come under attack, being as it is

just above the southern road.  If the compound were under attack the

crest would actually become a defensive measure, as it would be the

perfect height for an archer to stand behind and still be able to fire

off his arrows.

Guard Tower~
Dominating the view atop the wall, yet still completly hidden from below,

a medium-sized guard tower offers protection from the rainy nights here. 

Open on both the east and west, the tower's sole purpose appears to keep

a guard warm and dry on rainy evenings, evidenced as it is by a small

fire pit set into the wall.  Cunningly crafted the fire pit would allow

for a small flame to be present and yet not be visible by the casual

observer down below.  The courtyard below and to the north is visible,

allowing one to see any person entering or leaving any of the compound

buildings or the stronghold itself.  The road leading up to the compound

to the southeast is also visible as it crests the mountain and reaches

the plateau.

Standing atop the wall offers a spectacular view of not only the

surrounding area but also the inside of the compound.  Visible within the

courtyard to the north is the pearlescent walls of an ivory tower, a few

errant arrows protruding from the tops of its circular walls.  Looking

out over the walls, it almost appears as if there is no ground anywhere,

so close to the edge of the mountain plateau that the only sight is the

sky.  The path atop the walls, used mainly in defense of the compound

continues to both the east and west.

This section of the outer wall would be little used in the event of an

attack on the compound, directily below the outside of the walls, the

plateau drops off a frightening distance.  This dropoff does however

offer a beautiful view of the skyline to the south, allowing one to

lookout over extreme distances but also to see overtop of low lying

clouds if any were present.  The path atop the walls, used mainly in

defense of the compound continues to the west where it appears a

staircase is evident and to the west towards one of the guard towers.

Crumbling cliffs and deep vales scare the southern plateau.  Dark

fissures run linking one vale with other, it appears that it would be

possible to move across the plateau without ever rising above the dark

crevices rims.  Thick clumps of tussock stubbornly grown in the poor wind

swept ground.  Blasts of the icy gales buffer the wall and compound.

wall~
With only the wind and rain assaulting it, this section of wall shows

only small amounts of damage.  Flaking rocks and thin fissures mar some

of the stones.  Clumps of yellow and brown lichen cling to the wall,

almost invisible against the earthen-colored stones.

Top of the Stairs -- Along the Ramparts~
Chiseled directly into the wall is a narrow stairway, leading downward to

the bottom of the southwestern corner of the compound.  Moss covers most

of the staircase in dull green patches unbroken by any footprints. 

Normally a very strategic point in large area defense, this corner would

actually be little used in the event of combat, the area directly below

to both the south and west drops off to deadly heights and would be

unusable by anyone attacking via normal means.  A slight distance to the

north east, the top of an ivory tower is visible, while the path along

the top of the wall continues to both the north and east.

wall fissure crack~
Small fissures and cracks cover the stone wall, at first glance they

appear to be small, and shallow, although there are quiet a lot of them. 

Using these fissures to gain a hold, thick green moss and yellow lichen

has begun to carpet the area.  If left unchecked for too long this area

is going to need a gardener rather than a builder to maintain it.

~
E
stairway~
The narrow stairway descends sharply into the courtyard below.  A carpet

of moss has covered most of the steps in a thick green blanket in such an

extent that now, anyone descending need take great care of where they

place their feet.

~
E
moss lichen~
Enjoying the harsh conditions that stop larger plants from taking hold,

the green moss has blanketed the area in a moist carpet.  Thickly coating

the walls and stairwell it seems determined to claim this area as its own. 

Small patches of lichen seem to be about the only other plant growing

here, not surprising with the chilling wind mountain wind howling across

the walls.

E
ivory tower~
Rising out of the haze of the area is a slim, elegant tower.  Ivory in

color, it is a marvel to behold.  How it has survived where other

seemingly harder structures have falling is unclear from here.

Any guard stuck on duty in this section of the compound would find

himself hardpressed to not find the view astounding.  Staring out over

the eastern wall, the complete lack of ground lends a serene quality to

the otherwise dismal scenes in this degrading stronghold.  The ground is

barely visible at all, so close is it to the outer wall itself though it

widens out a great deal toward the north and the eastern road.  Staring

back into the compound, the black marble, silver veined temple stands in

silent memory of its once grandiose state, damaged as it is, it remains a

wonder to gaze upon.

The view of the mountains from here takes your breath away with its

beautiful, almost as breath taking as the cold wind that blows from their

icy tops.  Deep vales and high peaks spread out before you in a vast

panorama of stone and ice.

~
E
ground~
Of what you can make of the ground below it seems to be a mixture of

tussock, stone and fallen masonry.  The plateaus must see some harsh

seasons, the thriving plants all tend to be small and hiding in any

sheltered spot they can find.

~
E
temple~
Even from here it is clear that the dark marble building would have been

an impressive structure in its heyday.  Once tall, majestic arches and

high buttresses would have stretch toward the heavens.  However it

appears that war and years of neglect have combined with the harsh

elements, cracking and breaking many of its dark stones.

~
E
road~
The dusty, narrow road can been seen winding its way across the wind

journey through he high mountains.  At several places it disappears from

view, before cresting a rise to become visible again.

~
E
wall~
The earthen-colored stone of the walls shows some slight damage, small

chunks of rock lie at the base of the wall, and at the top of the wall

few fissures creep downwards, their tendrils spreading out, eroding the

structural integrity of some sections of the wall.  In the worse parts, ,

thick gray mortar has been applied to stop further spread of the already

significant damage.

A makeshift flagpole has recently been erected at this section of the

wall, appearing to be the shafts of two polearms tied together with old

fraying rope.  The flag of the cult of Morkith flying high enough that any

person approaching on the small road to the north east would have no

doubts as to the compound occupants.  The ground directly to the east of

the compound is nearly non-exsistant, the mountaintop plateau having

vectored in extremely close to the outer wall.  The one small advantage

of this being that an approaching army would be bottlenecked up on the

small road, the sole disadvantage being if a person fell from the wall,

its a very very long drop.

The dirt road weaves it's through the high mountain plateau, taking

Still appearing to be structurlly sound, the outer wall here has

obviously taken quite a beating from some sort of deadly war machine. 

Great chunks of rock has literally been shattered out of the wall, making

the once pristine symetric wall look lopsided.  The remains of a small

guard tower appear evident, the small roof that must have once stood

above has been completly destroyed and now lies in rubble in the

courtyard below.  The rooftop road continues to the north admist even

more destruction or back to south, the wall there appearing to be as new

as the day it was created.

wall~
Shattered in many places it is a wonder the wall still stands.  The

skilled masons that built the compound certainly built it to last. 

Although war machines that have torn great chunks of stone from the wall,

it still offers good defense to any huddled defenders, allowing them to

hold the wall against wave after wave of assaulting troops.

~
E
tower~
It seems that the tower was the target of some mighty war-machines.  Most

of it is now a shattered ruin.  The tower would have offered a much

better view of any approaching army than available from the wall, making

it an obvious target in any attack.  The base of the tower still stands,

as does part of the it south section, although now it does not rise much

above the wall, the remainder of the tower was blasted off the wall, to

fall in shattered ruins in the compound below.

Small chunks of rock litter the uneven and damaged path along the

great damage, large cracks and fissures mar the once smooth seamless

walls.  The wall is actually slightly lower here than to the south, but

appears to be in better condition then the rest of the outer wall to the

north.  Still barely defensibly sound, this section of the wall is in

need of a major overhaul, the only good thing is that the wall never

fell, thus it still provides some advantage over anyone approaching on

the small road to the east.

Total decimation is evident on this tortured section of the outer wall. 

The wall itself had actually been partially breached but as more damage

Fissures, crackes and rubble not only litter the area but is the norm

rather than the exception here.  A large gap is evident in the wall to

wall~
Blasted by the heavy hands of gigantic war machines the stones of the

wall here have been shattered apart.  Great gouges out of the wall have

sent tons of rocks cascading downwards to the ground below.  Rents and

fissures cover the broken wall, their tenders spreading across most of

stone flakes up.  Occasionally the clatter of falling rubble can be

The spiral stair continues toward the ceiling, stopping only for a small

The Arena of Champions~
A thick layer of fine sand covers the floor, colored a dark red in

several places.  Wooden racks line the walls, no doubt once filled with

all manners of weapons.  Carved above the empty weapon rack on the

southern wall is the creed of The Training Grounds, 'Knowledge is power'.

A quivering ball of mage light, slowly losing its power, hangs just a few

feet below the ceiling, still bright enough to light the arena grounds. 

The fine layer of sand stretches out as far as you can see to both the

west and north, while a slightly rusty steel ladder leads upstairs.

What may have once been brilliant in its simplicity now makes this room

look bare and lonely.  A small mat, now no more than a few bedraggled

threads still feebly clinging to each other, sits in front of the

shattered remains of a small table.  No ornaments adorn the walls, save a

single rusted incense burner.  A thick, carved mahogany door to the west,

blocks the only accessible passage out of this bare room.

silken cushions lie torn open on the floor amongst the splinters of

wooden pews.  A full-sized wooden organ, complete with mithril pipes sits

in an out of the way corner of the balcony.  Dark, sticky stains cover

the organ reminiscent of spilled wine.  The mithril pipes, show evidence

of both tarnish and abuse, no doubt someone failed in their attempt to

detach the pipes from the organ and the wall.

The Arena of Champions~
Having been ripped from the wall, a fully stocked weapons rack now covers

a portion of the sandy floor.  The weapons beneath it appear to have been

broken and bent under the weight of the massive wood rack.  The steel

clamps that once held the rack in place are still buried deep within the

cold stone walls.  An ephemeral ball of mage light hovers in the air just

a few feet below the ceiling, the remnants of the powerful spells that

were once cast upon the arena grounds.  A trail of blood-stained sand

leads farther into the arena to the north, evidence of a tragic fight

that took place in the not so distant path.

The Arena of Champions~
A flickering ball of mage light, hovering a few feet below the ceiling,

causes shadows to dance around in this corner of the arena.  Wooden

training dummies, now broken, lend their forms to the dancing shadows,

making it difficult to focus on any one shape.  A large section of the

stone floor in the center of the room has been cleared of its fine layer

of sand.  Light can be seen at a short distance to both the south and the

west, perhaps emanting from more of the powerful magics worked here

quite some time ago.

The Arena of Champions~
The upper most layers of the fine sand have been turned into a hard,

coagulated crimson mass.  No doubt a massive battle occured here, proven

by the amount of blood that would be necessary to turn such a large

amount of the sand into the now hardened substance.  Buried into the

northern wall is the shattered remains of an axe head, its shaft no

longer attached to the jagged metal embedded into the rock.  Splintered

into a millon pieces, the remains of a weapons rack lie mixed in with the

sand layered upon the ground.

Storage Room~
The shattered remains of the storage room door lies amongst the empty,

overturned crates that litter the room.  The crates may have once held

exotic foods from across the lands, many bearing markings from far-away

cities, though now they all appear to be empty.  Deep gouges have been

hacked into the dark wooden walls, no doubt in an attempt to find hidden

passages, obviously none were found by this destructive attempt.  A

rusty, steel ring, wet with condensation is the only noticeable blemish

that betrays the existence of a finely crafted trapdoor set into the 

northern section of the floor.

Training Ground's Kitchen~
A large fireplace dominates the eastern wall of the room with an

apparently often used spit sitting over it.  The smell of decay permeates

the air, caused by the rotting carcass of a rabbit floating in the small

basin used as a sink.  A large preparation table spans the entire center

of the kitchen, heavily scarred from the sharp knives used by the

cooking staff.  A trapdoor is set into the southern section of the floor,

just below the large open window which gives a scenic view of the outside

training grounds.

window still gleam in dark jewel tones from the center of the facade, now

gaping holes diminishing its beauty.  Wickedly grinning gargoyles carved

from the same night-colored stone of the walls surround the gaping hole

filled with jagged pieces of stained glass.

Cold water sluggishly rolls down the southern wall of this storage room,

funneled across the room in a wooden trough.  Dimly pulsing orbs of white

light hang at equal intervals above the trough.  The water appears to be

magically moved across the room, through the trough, towards the northern

wall.  Large steel hooks, covered with coagulated blood hang from the

ceiling overtop of now rotted and broken tables.  Wooden shelves lining

every square inch of wallspace are now totally bare save cobwebs and moss. 

A carved wooden ladder, slimy with mold and mildew, leads up to a large

Every table in the room has been destroyed, glancing around you can see

large weight dropped on top of them breaking the tabletop and splitting

the furniture in two.  Still others show the natural damage of rot and

termites, these obviously destroying more of the wood than any malicious

tables that meat is supposed to sit on.  Large hooks hang from the

ceiling, to be used in the curing process of beef and chicken.  The stone

tables that ring the firepit in the center of the room have been gouged

deeply, ruining their value but not their practical use.  A thick, stone

door designed to help keep all possible heat in the room, blocks your

The ivory spiral stair curves up toward the ceiling and disappears down a

door at chest height, somehow twisting in upon itself even as you watch.

Destroyed Workroom~
The forces of entropy seem to have had a hand in the utter chaos of what

looks to have formerly been a mage's workroom.  Books, scrolls, broken

glass, and other items not easily identifiable are strewn across the

floor and atop the large stone table in the center of the room.  The west

wall is covered in soot, seemingly reaching out from a small fireplace as

if in some kind of explosion.  Half-burned books lie along the edge of

the blast radius, and it seems likely that someone was possessed of the

bad idea to throw a spellbook into the fire.

Destroyed Bedchamber~
Once a comfortable sleeping area, this tiny room has been reduced to a

shambles.  Books spill out of a set of wooden shelves with the plinths

broken, apparently by some sharp, hacking weapon.  Fragments of tinder

litter gaping wounds of what was once a solid oaken bed, that now has one

of its posts hacked off and tossed across the room.  A tiny painting must

have once hung above the mantle of the fireplace, as is evidenced by the

slim wooden frame that still hangs there, the canvas shredded and

littering the mantlepiece and slowly rotting.

books wooden shelves plinths~
Obviuosly destroyed by someone who cared not for books, this bookshelf

certainly appears to have been damaged by a sharp hacking style weapon. 

Also evidencing this a few of the books lying on the ground have great

gauges literally cut through them, destroying a fair amount of pages in

the process.

solid oaken bed post~
Standing slightly lopsided now, this once elegant oaken bed has now had

its value all but totally destroyed.  Great gashes and scratch marks

cover the bed nearly from head to toe, and the sleeping pad also appears

to have been partially shredded.

slim frame canvas litter mantlepiece~
Whetever this small painting once was, its depiction has been forever

lost in time.  The canvas has been tottally shredded and even the color

seems to have been leached over the course of years of neglect.  The

small shreds litter the mantlepiece, though by no means is there enough

to have been a full-size picture, were the rest of it is, is also another

mystery.

Tower Stair~
The ivory stair continues rising through the air towards the ceiling and

disappears down a hole in the floor.  The complete absence of a support

pillar lends an air of magic to the ever-twisting, ever-rising staircase.

A small ivory door stands at the far edge of a single ledge that juts out

from the spiral stair before it once again curves heaven-ward.  A vibrant

crimson light pulses from an intricate rune carved into the door to the

west, its incessant pulsing nearly causing you to lose your balance and

fall down the staircase.

Ivory Spiral Stair~
The ivory stair disappears down toward the base of the tower, curving in

upon itself with no support pillar evident.  The railings seem to be more

serpents coiling through the air along with the stair than just pieces of

carved, cold stone.  An intricate rune carved directly into the ivory

door to the west, pulses a bright, majestic magenta, its light causing

Decimated Laboratory~
Destruction and mayhem have run rampant in what looks to be the wreckage

of an old laboratory.  Vast sections of the room are buried beneath solid

sheets of glass, the affects of a raging fire upon the uncounted vials,

beakers and jars once housed in the ruined room.  Glass wasn't the only

fatality of the heat, the walls themselves ran molten, destroying

intricate webs of runes that covered their once-glossy surfaces. 

Sporadic, pale pulses of light still emanate from some of the runes,

hinting that a portion of the great magicks cast here are still intact. 

A single sigil stands out, throbbing crimson upon the eastward door.

High Mage's Room~
The entire room seems to have every item exactly in its place.  No

battles appear to have been fought here, unlike the rest of the compound. 

A few scorch marks do mar the surface of the ivory floor, just in front

of the small fireplace midway in the northern wall.  Bookshelves abound,

covering nearly every available inch of wall space, while a desk of black

marble dominates the center of the chamber.  A glowing mage globe casts a

soft crimson light, causing the ivory surfaces to glow an evil red.  A

small archway leads out to a balcony to the west, freeing a cold breeze

to flow continually through the chamber.

Crushed Gravel Pathway~
A path of fine, powdery gravel, once cushioning the footfalls of the

Training Ground's residents, meanders parallel to the guildhall walls. 

Sporadic trees, grown well into maturity, soar skyward, at one time

providing shade for those wandering here.  The trees' limbs, no longer

clothed in lush greenery, droop now, their barren branches depressed and

sickly.  The walkway continues northward, and southward the grounds

opening up before the site of an ivory tower.

Crushed Gravel Pathway -- Along the Western Wall~
A path of fine powdery gravel, once used to cushion the footfalls of the

residents of The Training Grounds, meanders parallel to the walls of the

guildhall.  Remnants of a short hedge runs along side the path, standing

between you and the barren limbed trees that once provided shade for the

guildhall, and to the north towards a large tree.

Crushed Gravel Pathway~
Faint gurgling sounds can be heard coming from the east as you stand here

at a T-junction in the crushed gravel pathway.  A towering tree, barren

limbed and sap dripping still stands protectivly over top a scarred and

chipped crystalline bench.  A small marker stone sits at the base of the

barren tree, even covered in sap its inscriptions are still easily

readable.  The crushed gravel path travels in all directions save north,

which is blocked by the crystalline bench and its living companion.

Beside a Fountain~
The gravel pathway has been crafted into a circular path here, ringing

the exquisite fountain that stands before you.  The fountain captures the

visage of a forest unicorn in mid-rear, its crafter created it in such a

way that it is eerily lifelike.  This small circular path, complete with

fountain looks to be untouched by time, the statue still appears to be as

new as the day it was carved, the gravel is still fresh and clean. 

Slight gurgling noises emanate from the fountain as if its magic's were

still attempting to toss water up into the air for it to idly shower down

on the unicorn.

Crushed Gravel Pathway -- Along the Western Wall~
A carefully sculpted turn in the pathway leads off to the north.  The

track was once edged by a fine hedge, which now lies trampled and dying. 

A large wooden structure is evident just a short distance to the north

along the pathway.  The curving gravel trail leads off to both the east

and the north, large trees growing to the west prevent all travel in that

direction.

This hedge appears to have once been a pleasant marker for the edge of

The remnants have been trampled into the ground by uncaring feet, though

a few still appear as if there is some slight life left in them.

Before a Wooden Barn~
The building before you has been made entirely of a thick, dark wood the

likes of which you have never seen.  Barely noticeable through the trees

to the west is the wall that surrounds The Training Grounds' compound.  A

small hitching post sits off to the east of the gravel path. No doubt

this was mainly used for the harnessing of a horse till a stableboy was

able to tend to the beast.  The crushed gravel lends itself to an easy

hike to the south, while the inside of the barn is accessible through the

large double doors to the north, which appear to be set with a large,

sturdy beam and a lock.

~
large beam/lock for the stable doors

[Haine] fixed a messup in rdesc..added rextra for door.  noticed rbug 1

and added a beam and lock to the rdesc..hopefully in the way you had

invisioned.  Added beam to the door rextra keywords and rdesc for it..and

added an rextra for the lock.  Hope neither are too long.

[Cyndra] hmm...how do i know the building to the west is called the training grounds?

[Cyndra] actually isn't the building east and north?

[Adakar] no building to the west, just the compounds outer wall...the compound itself is called the training grounds

[Cyndra] look north door blah should be an acode

[Cyndra] acode 2, adata 1: cannot is one word

[Haine] since there is a beam, when area resets how will getting out work? 

one possible solution is force people to use the rope exit..forces a

little more reading and is more fun 

[Haine] Haine was here.

[Haine] look north is now an acode that sends two messages depending on state of the beam, might change more when the lock is added

In front of the beams rest a large, almost brassy lock.  It is probably

just under a foot in length, and dangles loosely from the bolts set into

the gate's front.  It appears to have once been copper in color, but

weathering has turned it into a tattered, brassy looking metal.  In the

center of the lock rests a large keyhole that appears a bit bent out of

shape, as if someone put too much strength into turning a key.  Combined

with the beam it is locking down, it appears these doors are well

fastened.

two doors is an immensely-thick wooden beam, easily strong enough to keep

more than animals from getting out.  The beam appears very sturdy and

therefore quite effective in doing what it was probably set there to do

-- keep things inside.  In front of the beams rest a large, almost brassy

Inside the Stable~
You stand at the front of a beautifully built covered stable.  Small

candle holders dot the free space on the walls next to the stable doors

to the both the east and west.  Remnants of tallowed candles rest in each

of the candle holders, no doubt they were once used by the young

stableboys when late night guests arrived at The Training Grounds.  A set

of large double doors bars access to the outside world beyond the stable

itself.

Small, aged candle holders line the free space of the walls to the east

and west, probably once providing a good deal of light.  Each candle

holder has the remnants of tallow candle wax beads and clumps, falling

around the edges.  At one time, all these candles probably provided the

night light for stable boys up late welcoming midnight guests and their

horses to The Training Grounds complex.

E
south double doors gate~
Glancing south, the two large doors that you came through present

themselves in the dark shadow cast from the lightless room.  The wood

appears to be the same strange and dark wood as on the outside, but it's

hard to tell if it is because of lack of light or not.  Strange claw

markings present themself in the door, but they're really hard to make

out.

~
E
claw marking~
Strange claw markings are found in a few places near the base of the

doors.  Upon further inspection, it is obvious they aren't from a very

large creature -- this much can be ascertained by touch -- but little

else is obvious such as the size or length of the claw, because of the

nearly complete pitchiness around this area.

Small Stable Stall~
A discoloration appears in the southwestern corner of the wall in this

stable stall.  The stain may very well have been caused by an animal that

had been backed into that corner and summarily slaughtered, as it appears

to be thicker near the center of the smear.  Only a few stray pieces of

hay lie scattered across the dark wooden floor, obviously no animals have

been kept here in quite some time.  A gate, just large enough for a full

sized war horse to walk through blocks your access to the east and the

stables beyond.

result of running or spillage.

E
few stray peices hay floor~
Small peices of hay lay sparcely scattered about the stall floor.  Some

appear mildewed from age, others are slightly nibbled on, probably from

rats or other small creatures.  Regardless, there is hardly enough to

support a horse, so it is obvious the stall has been abandoned for a

while.

Small Stable Stall~
The sweet smell of burnt hay assaults you as you enter the stable stall. 

A pile of ash and remnants of burnt hay lie just underneath the charred,

yet still standing eastern wall.  A small discolored rectangle appears on

the southern wall, possibly the only remaining proof that a plaque once

adorned the wooden walls.  A small, empty feeding trough and a water pail

filled with fetid water are attached to the divider between this stall

and its northern neighbor.  The only available exit is through the wooden

stable gate to the west, though a small child might attempt exit through

the window in the southern wall.

Remnants of burnt hay and ash intertwine in a seemingly dirty pile under

E
eastern wall charred~
A badly charred eastern wall is quite visible.  In plain light it could

be more easily identifiable, but in the dark stable shadows it is hard to

notice much of the crumbled ruins.  There is one spot on the wall

jet-black in ash which was probably the focal point of damage, and it

moved on from there.

~
E
rectangle discolored plaque southern~
On the southern wall, a discolored rectangle is rather obvious.  Probably

there was once a plaque on the wall of the equestrial type, but the

damage in the room that is noticeable probably also resulted in its

disappearance.

Inside the Stable~
You stand at the back of the covered stables, a stall to both the east

and the west.  A single bag of high quality feed lies ripped open on the

floor, its contents spilled out across the bed of bloody hay covering the

wooden floor.  A hastily crafted lock has been set into the stall door to the

west, a sign written in shaky handwriting hangs crookedly above the lock. 

Attached to the northern wall are wooden pegs, typically used by the

stableboys to hang up their tools, hanging from one is the decomposing

skull of an aged dwarf.

A dingy old burlap feed bag lies here half-ripped, it's contents spilling

down the moldy-yellow stalks and formed puddles near the base, even

spilling out onto the wooden floor.

Splintered and worn by age, five wooden pegs are fastened to the northern

wall.  Probably used by stableboys to hang tools, all but one is empty

and the rest don't look so capable of holding much anyways -- they

actually look like they'd break quite easily.  The one holding something,

the farthest right one, has a gruesome skull hanging from it, the peg

poking out of it's right eye.  The skull is somewhat decomposing, as it

has probably been here for a while, and has a large crack near what

appears to have been the ear.

A small empty watering pail sits next to a feeding trough, both firmly

the skeleton of a goblin stableboy.  It is hard to determine if there are

any holes or fractures, so cause of death is hard to determine.  The

bones appear quite in order, indicating they probably haven't been here

for long, as the effects of nature haven't had time to move them from

their original positions.

Before the Gates~
Looming grimly over its surroundings, a massive stone archway soars

skyward.  Centered at the apex of the arch, a cracked and crumbling crest

perches just above a pair of crystalline doors crafted of milky quartz. 

Deep scratches and scorch marks mar the surface of these glistening

portals, where a shattered fragment broken from one disfigures an

octagonal hole set into the middle of its translucent surface.  No hinges

can be seen in the doors nor seams and footings in the earth-colored

ground entirely by the force of powerful magicks.

Smooth, seamless walls rise to the south, forming the first layer of

depth of ten feet.  The water is still, apparently stagnant, though the

occasional ripple flows across its surface, hinting of an unseen source

feeding into the pool from below.

Along the Wall~
A small hitching post shelters beneath the limbs of a spreading oak tree. 

If this tree were clothed in lush foliage, any animal tethered there

would rest comfortably in relevant shade.  Unfortunatly few leaves adorn

the outstretched limbs of this old, wooden giant, nor do any appear to

have been dropped recently from its branches.  A field of dried grass

continues on towards the west, approaching the corner of the walls of the

compound while slightly to the southeast the front gates are evident.

hitching post~
The wooden hitching post angles slightly to the left, the oaken

crosspiece loose within the hole where it rests.  This main beam shows

evidence of heavy use although it still seems to be quite solid, ready for

the next horse to be tethered there.

E
large oak tree limbs wooden giant~
The oak is ancient, massive in scope and tall, its uppermost branches

reaching far into the heavens, yet held firmly earth-bound by a century's

growth of roots that delve deeply into the soil of this place.  There is

an air of sadness, even mourning, in the aged limbs that droop slightly

toward the ground.

E
walls stone~
The stone that makes up these seamless walls is the exact color of the

ground underfoot.  The complete lack of seams in the towering walls

combined with this perfect color gives a very strong impression that the

walls were forced from the earth itself by powerful magicks.

Hay Loft~
A large, square glass-less window takes up the entire northern wall of

the small hayloft.  A slightly frayed rope hangs from a beam just outside

of the window, once used to lift the hay up to this level.  Sections of

the wooden floor have rotted away leaving gaping holes where hay was once

stored.  Old, mildewy straw litters the remaining floor, its only

effective use is a home for the many bugs that crawl through it.  A

rickety plank has been placed across the largest hole leading to the

southern section of the loft, while a wooden ladder leads back down to

the stable floor.

E
large square glass-less window rope frayed~
Taking up most of the northern wall is an immense cut-out, square in

shape.  It is hard to tell if at one time maybe it contained glass, but

it doesn't now.  The bottom ledge of it is a bit worn from abuse,

probably the activeness of feet here.  A large rope hangs from a beam

just outside the window, likely used to hall hay up into the loft.  The

stableboys hauling the hay were probably the busy feet that wore out the

bottom surface of the window while doing their job.

~
E
sections wooden floor gaping holes~
Scattered about the loft are gaping holes of considerable proportions. 

Hay was probably once scattered about the area over them, but some places

have long since rotted away, making the area a trecherous place to walk

around.

~
E
old mildewy straw~
Like most the hay found throughout the stables, the pieces found here are

quite green in color indicating extreme mildewing.  It's clumped in

little areas amongst the holes in the ground and seems to have corners

nibbled out, definitely the work of some hungry rodents.  From the warmth

of here, it is probably a good assumption things are living in the larger

clumps, as they would make good living spaces for smaller creatures.

~
E
rickety plank~
A large wooden plank, probably two and a half feet in width covers a

large, gaping hole in the center of the loft, providing passage to the

southern part of this upstairs area.  Despite the buildings consistent

antiquity, this plank does not seem to show any signs of age, so it is

probably safe to assume it is strong enough to walk on.

Marble Hallway~
Dank and dusty, the hallway appears to have lost most of the natural

beauty created by the silver laced, obsidian marble.  The vaulted

ceilings, though covered with cobwebs appear to have survived the

vandalism that has been reaped upon the rest of the marble.  Chipped and

scratched, the once elegant arches stand a quiet sentinel for the rooms

to the north and south.  Rusting steel sconces set into the western wall

hold the remains of torches that have sputtered out long ago, these being

yet another reminder of the neglect of the stronghold.  A spiral stair

leads back up to the alcove within the temple proper, while the hallway

continues to the east.

Dust swirls around the room, tossed about by your passage through the

appear to have survived the vandalism that has been reaped upon the rest

of the marble.  Chipped and scratched, the once elegant arches stand a

quiet sentinel for the rooms to the north and south.  A single sigil

adorns the top of each of the archways, perhaps once denoting ownership

of the rooms.  The dusty marble hallway leads to both the east and west,

though cold air seems to flow from the east.

Marble Hallway~
A heavily runed archway is set into the northern wall, dominating your

vision of the dead end in the hallway.  Cobwebs and dust cover every

square inch of the dark marble, including the vaulted ceilings, save for

the engraved archway to the north.  A near identical archway stands to

the south, though by far less intricately runed, and lacking the magical

glow of the arched gateway to the north.  A large crest can be seen

through the dust covering the dark marble on the eastern wall, though

scarred and vandalized the Training Grounds crest can still be identified. 

The marble hallway leads off to the west, away from the engraved archway.

Living Quarters~
A large circular bed dominates the center of the room, topped by an

intricate metal sigil fashioned to work as a canopy.  Runic engravings,

some of which have been purposefully corrupted, surround the bed in a

mystic circle of power.  At the center of the metallic canopy, there is a

small diamond shaped hole, no doubt it once held some sort of holy object

that was the focal point for some unknown clerical ritual.  The

personalized sigil that once topped the archway to the south has been

completely obliterated, perhaps due to some superstitious reasoning of

the vandals that damaged the circle to begin with.

Living Quarters~
Little remains of this room, almost as if a huge explosion ripped through

the room sometime in the distant path.  The once majestic dark marble

walls have been crushed and collapsed in amongst themselves, making the

room little bigger than a closet.  An ornate, golden shrine can still be

seen through a small crevice in the tons of rock that has fallen upon it. 

Though which god this shrine belongs to is unclear, it is obvious that

the shrine is worth a small fortune.  The only way out of the

rubble-strewn room is through the archway to the north.

Shadows dance about the room, cast by a small tallow candle set in a

northern corner of the room, a small shrine resides covered with

paintings of a beautiful woman, partly covered with a strange black goo. 

On the western wall, a faded tapestry hangs by mere threads, while on the

eastern wall a painting depicts a small family.  Upon the back wall

stands a mysterious rack, covered in ebony, ivory and sapphire, most of

this showing some slight damage.  A small bed lies under the rack,

covered in the tattered remains of a once elegant blanket.

This small tallow candle looks to be newly lit as no wax appears to be

The shrine is covered in a black viscous gooy substance, even through

through a small patch of trees.  As you look closer, you can make out men

in the trees armed with bows staring back at you.

Living Quarters~
An ornate tapestry of a rampant black unicorn wreathed in black roses

dominates the room, hung in the center of the southern wall.  The

masterwork of a skilled craftsman, the threads gleam in the reflected

light of several braziers lit with flickering mage globes.  A second

tapestry, this one depicting a map of the known realm, hangs on the

eastern wall.  A simple mahogany bed, showing the same craftsmanship as

the desk, rests in the western corner.  Strangely untouched by the

wreckage of the temple above, this room seems unusually shadowed for the

lights still within.

Elegant stitches picked out in brilliant jewel-toned thread, it is almost

Entrance to Clerical Training Grounds~
As if standing guard, two ten foot statues stand side by side, a human

sized mithril door perched between them.  The statues give the strong

impression of watching your every move as you enter the room, appraising

your reasoning for being here.  No footprints are evident in the thin

layer of dust on the floor, and the room looks as new as the day it was

only accessible access out of the room.

Living Quarters~
A faintly glowing mage globe hovers near the central point of the vaulted

ceiling, illuminating a stunning depiction of a forest unicorn.  This

room appears to have survived most of the vandalism which has run rampant

throughout the compound.  The marble walls are still smooth to the touch

except for a heavily engraved section of the southern wall.  Obviously

the original owner of this room greatly enjoyed mahogany, as both the

desk and the large bed appear to be made of solid pieces of this

expensive wood.  Gauging the size of both of these pieces of furniture,

its quite obvious that neither could have fit through the archway to the

north, how they arrived in here is anyone's guess.

As you stare up at the painting of the forest unicorn, realization slowly

Between a Tower and the Wall~
A dry and beaten bed of brown grass, long dead, recedes from growing

patches of desolate dirt.  Rising prominently from the lifeless field, a

seamless ivory tower lies northward, black scorch marks covering its

polished surface to a level of twenty feet.  To the south, the arid plot

ends abruptly at the base of the earthen-hued stone of the walls.  The

field of dead and drying vegetation continues on toward the east and west.

Beside the Wall~
From the middle of this vast field of dried grass, only the outer walls

of the compound break the monotony of the flatness.  Two ancient bales of

hay have tumbled to the ground here, remnants of colorful paints

emblazoned on the outside of the bundles.  Half buried in a splotch of

bright red, a single arrow protrudes from what must have been the

uppermost bale.  A short distance to the west lies the corner of the

compound, while off to the east lies the skeleton of a large tree.

Mass Grave Site~
The earth beneath your feet has been completly turned, it is obvious that

this is the site of a shallow mass grave.  The ground is uneven, mounds

of dirt lie heaped in piles in roughly humanoid shapes.  A few random

bones can be seen sticking out of the ground at odd angles seemingly for

the sole reason of not being completly covered to begin with.  Ironically

there is no evidence of a fight having occured on this spot, though

perhaps that is why someone chose to bury the dead here.  The gravel

pathway to the north may also have been a deciding factor in the location

of the burial ground.

South of an Ancient Tree~
Chunks of rock and fine gravel intermingle with shattered bones amongst

the trampled, dead grass underfoot.  A venerable, towering oak, its trunk

so wide ten people encircling its vast girth would be unable to touch

each other's hands, blocks further progress to the north.  Bound to the

trunk of the tree is a human skeleton, rusting iron spikes evident in

this tortured body, still skewer its wrists in place.  A short distance

to the east lies a gravel walkway, allowing easier progress than this

rubble-strewn field.

The human carcass bound to the tree almost overshadows the majesty of

this wooden behemoth.  Although the skeleton is perfectly intact, no

skeleton's bone structure is quite large and there is evidence of

long-healed breaks and chips remaining from its mortal life, 

~
E
rusting iron spikes~
Unable to see the spikes in their entirety, it is evident that these

rusting implements' sole purpose was the perpetration of slow, hideous

torture.  A blood groove cut along one edge allowed for a continuous

seepage of the victim's life's blood, until the poor soul bled to death.

Beside the Ivory Tower~
Small chunks of rock and fine gravel make up the remnants of an overgrown

gravel pathway.  Nature overtook the walkway long since, a tale told by

dead weeds and grass violating its surface.  The field is by no means

flat and level like its surroundings, although no evidence remains to

indicate what might have altered the landscape in such a small, localized

area.  A large tower of pearlescent ivory, heavily scratched and gouged,

rises forth from the ground to the south.

Behind the Barn~
You come to a dead-end facing a substantially large, wooden barn.  The

barn is made out of a very dark, very strange wood, rousing interest. 

Glancing up, a large, glassless window set into the side of the upper

level of the barn becomes noticeable.  Hanging from a pully attached to

the roof, a rope dangles in front of the window -- this probably being

the way occupants hauled hay to the upper-level for storage.  Back to the

north is the overgrown dirt path leading away from this mysterious barn. 

To the west you can see the outter walls of the compound through large,

haunted trees.  An overgrown row of hedges parallels the path on the east

side, blocking passage.

As you look at the large barn in front of you, one thing becomes quite

clear, it is built of an extremely odd-looking wood.  It is very dark,

and appears quite thick and sturdy.  The color is dark, but hard to

identify as it seems to change..sort of?  maybe?  It seems to be a

deep-purple, but has the odd sparkle of carbon.

E
glassless window~
In the upper part of this building, maybe twenty feet high, is set a

large, square opening, a window per se, just without glass, which was

probably original intentions.  Above is set a pully in the roof, with a

rope dangling down in front of the window.

E
pully rope~
A simple pully is attached in the roof here, swaying softly in the gentle

winds.  Hanging from the pully is a substantially thick, brown rope that

ends in front of the window.  Putting two and two together, you assume

this pully, rope, and window combination was used to raise hay to the

upper levels of the barn.

Hay Loft~
Most of the floor of this section of the hayloft has rotten away leaving

large gaping wounds.  Straw litters the remaining floor boards, excluding

a small square in the southern corner.  The remnants of a small living

area appear to be in the cleared out area of straw.  A small bedroll lies

next to a rusting bucket, while a pile of hay sits at the head of the

bedroll seemingly forming a pillow.  The only exit appears to be a

rickety plank that stretches across the largest hole in the floor to the

northern side of the hayloft.

Bell Tower~
You are in a small tower at the absolute peak of the marble temple.  A

large golden bell is hanging from an extremly thick chain that disappears

through a small hole in an oaken beam that supports the domed roof.  A

single window set into the western wall gives you a spectacular view of

the compounds front yard.  Appearing to be quite small, the ivory tower

can be seen just at the edge of your vision at the extreme western edge

of the compound.  A small trapdoor set into the marble floor is the only

access out of the bell tower.

This heavy golden bell appears to be extremely heavy judging from the

Crushed Gravel Pathway~
As the path starts proceeding beyond the overlapping shadows thrown by

the two buildings, more detail of the ground and the structures is

available to the eye.  The golden building, accented by two lovely

windows, one on each side of the wall, has an intricately carved writing

of some sort all about the outside, or so it appears.  The wooden

structure to the west is crafted of a strange, dark wood that seems to

sparkle in the available light, almost purplish.  At the base of the

wall, a large ant hill rises up at least three feet, looking pretty

dangerous..  The path meanders north, where it opens up into a large

grass field, although some parts appear to be dead.

The golden beauty to the east looks especially nice at this angle, its

tall walls of gold rising high and majestic.  Two windows on each side of

this wall of the building look quite large, and very luxurious in design. 

The whole height and width of the wall, only paused by the two windows,

is a flowing script of some sort, intricately carved, and appearing to

wrap around the whole building.

1 west wooden purplish ant anthill mound~
The walls, rising twenty feet or more, are crafted of a fine wood of deep

brown hue, that appears to sparkle a purple color when the light hits it

right.  Grasses of knee-height brush the sides of the structure, blowing

calmy in the available breezes.  At the base, rising three feet or more,

is an enmormous ant hill, built of loose peices of dark gray sand.  The

ant hill seems abnormally large, and you think you better not mess with

it..

Crushed Gravel Pathway~
The path here is an alley of sorts, narrowing as it cuts between the

golden structure to the east, and the wooden one to the west.  The

structure to the west is built entirely of dark wood, and appears to be

quite sturdy and strong, although small signs of weathering are apparent. 

Green grasses grow at the base, and even some flowers are noticeable,

which is a contrast to the usual death and decay of things found

elsewhere here.  The building of gold to the east looks quite

spectacular, a solid side of pure gold, set with two grand windows.  The

path continues north around to the other sides of the two buildings,

possibly to entrances.

1 west structure dark wood~
Standing probably twenty feet or more in height, the building is made of

a strange, dark wood, almost purplish in appearance.  The building looks

quite sturdy, and the wood quite hard; no obvious signs of the purpose of

the building or why it is so strongly built.  Despite its architectural

sublimity, signs of aging and weathering are present.  Rain has caused

the color to wash out in certain places, causing lighter blotches of wood.

base flowers grasses life~
Grasses of nearly a foot, with narrow blades, dust the sides of the

wooden building, looking quite lush, actually.  A few flowers, none very

welcome sign of life and vibrance.

Crushed Gravel Pathway~
Coming to a break in the path, the main gravel road has an intersecting

branch to the east, that leads all the way alongside a golden building to

the east wall, which is where the view stops.  An ancient tree of

gargantuan proportion blocks any movement west, its long winding branches

twisted into the sky and playing in the clouds.  The tree appears to be

very lifeless and dead, lacking any signs of greenery.  North, past the

tree, the gravel walkway moves alongside a wooden building, not appearing

to have any special markings or structures on the outside, but looking

quite simple.

An ancient tree rises into the sky west of here, forcing the path to wrap

hinting that the tree is probably dead, which is no suprise considering

the rest of this place seems to share that same trait.

Backyard~
As travel progresses about this place, more and more scenes lacking in

life are noticed, and the sense of coldness and dread becomes more

overwhelming.  Running horizontally south of here, a once lush row of

hedges about the size of a dwarf has long since lost most of its green

foliage, looking no more than a tangle of twigs and branches, with the

occasional leaf.  A giant bird nest rests inside one of the openings, but

no signs of a mother or babies can be seen or heard, leading to believe

that the nest is probably abandoned.  Southwest of here, a fountain comes

into view as the path wraps around it in a circle.  Northeast is a nice

change of scenery; a building crafted of pure gold it seems, providing a

bit of warmth to handle the cold feelings emitted from the lack of life

here.

A long row of short hedges runs on the south side of the area, heading

east.  Very few leaves are left on the bushes, just an entwined mess of

non-herbaceous stems zig-zagging around and about each other, making

passage impossible.  Built into a few supportive stems is a very large

bird nest, probably that of a crow.  No babies or mother can be seen or

heard, so the nest is probably abandoned.

Southwest a ways, the gravel path winds its way around a lovely fountain,

appear to hold any water, but you could swear you heard gurgling sounds.

Behind a Golden Building~
Gold sheeting covers most of the stone building to the north, making it

appear to be crafted out of solid gold.  Small sections of the wall have

been nearly completely obliterated in the attempt to remove the precious

metal.  Intricate carvings of what appears to be a flowing script still

covers the remaining sheets of gold, though segments of whatever story

they told are now missing.  Towering high above to the south are ancient

oak trees, seemingly guarding the backside of the once-gleaming building. 

Barely capable of being considered a path, lightly trampled grass runs

along the back of the building to the east.

No longer gleaming, the golden walls of the building to the north still

bear intricate carvings of what appears to be some sort of flowing script. 

Standing guard over top of these storytelling walls is a long line of oak

trees.  Reaching heights of mammoth proportions, the limbs of these

ancient giants appear to have a slight droop to them almost as if they

were in mourning.  An almost imperceptible path of slightly trampled,

dead grass continues to both the east and west along the backside of the

building.

Along the Wall~
Scorched stone, ashes, peices of broken and burnt wood are laying

everywhere here.  Brushes of gray, black, and deep red paint a scene of

destruction on the surreal canvas of ground and wall.  What is left of

the wall, that is.  A big chunk of the wall in hyperbolic shape is gone,

the stone around it shattered and charred.  Like a leopard skin, spots of

black coat the once massive defensive structure, now cowering on the

ground in pitiful heaps.  On the ground, once lengthy grasses growing

along the path here are flattened and burned.  The scene of destruction

is so vivid your mind fools you into thinking you still smell burning

grass and smoke.  Amidst the ruins of the wall, wedged between some

fallen stones are a few pikes that may have once been majestic

flag-holders on the ramparts, but now lay up-pointed in the rubble, still

appearing to be intact and sharp.  The path T's here, the bisected line

running north and south along the wall, the intersecting part of the T

heading west along the adjacent side of the golden building.

Burnt wood, ashes, charred remains of stone and grasses.  Something of

everything that could be destroyed in this part of the complex was.  The

smell of evil and destruction rises in every piece of gray soot awakened

burnt remains of what was once a high, protecting wall and a nice grassy

Tumbling down onto the ground into mounds of dust and broken stone, the

parts of the wall.

pike wedged fallen flag-holders up-pointed sharp~
A few pikes of about eight feet in length are wedged nicely between some

large chunks of fallen bits of wall.  The pikes point upward at random

angles, and look quite sharp despite the damage done to most everything

here.  The fact they all point up, are wedged, and sharp, just seems a

bit coincidental though, but the stones holding them are huge, so it is

likely they were not set that way on purpose.

Along the Wall~
If having a structure made elaborately of gold was not impressive enough,

intricate carvings litter the entire face of the wall.  Not just

decorations, even someone unable to understand what it is saying is able

to tell there is a flow to the carvings, a script of sorts.  A couple

glances at the carvings in the wall presses a feeling of intriguement and

mystery into the mind as to what they could possibly be saying.  The

expanse of the gold building leads north for a good ways, and the

carvings seem to extend down further along the wall, although because of

the angles it is not possible to tell if they're on the wall too far down. 

The path follows north nestled between the eastern wall and the golden

building and beyond, but a smaller path, worn through the grasses, leads

around the corner of the building to the adjacent side.  The eastern wall

in this part seems to be in good shape, but shows no signs that it became

this way because of repairing, possibly leading to believe it was never

damaged too badly in this part.

1 west golden building carvings~
Carvings of meticulous handywork swarm on the golden wall like bees to a

honeycomb.  Covering every visible inch, the carvings are very neat and

precise, probably taking considerable time and care to form.  No clue as

to what they mean is present, but one can only be sure they mean

something, as the carvings flow and seem to have pattern to them.  They

seem to not only be in this part but the whole wall, although it is

difficult to tell if they are on the parts farther down, but it is

probably safe to assume they are.

1 eastern wall~
The eastern wall has shown considerable signs of damage in other places,

but in this paticular spot it seems quite intact.  It is obvious that

repair is taking place in this facility, but no signs of it are visible

on the wall to suggest that it was once damaged and now repaired, so it

is safe to assume that this was just a lucky spot.

Along the Wall~
Making for a nice walk beside such a marvel, the path here is

approximately in the middle of the golden wonder.  The entire expansion

of the wall here is inundated in enscribings of fine detail.  Upon more

observation, it appears to have certain order and pattern to it.  Visible

on the wall quite a ways up is an irregular circle of a glowing green. 

It does not appear to be a substance on the wall, but just the color of

the wall in this certain spot.  The wall in this part appears to have

been damaged, but is undergoing repairs, as freshly spread mortar is seen

in places.  Against the base of the wall is an upright wheelbarrow, very

large and full of what looks like some stones and maybe a tool or two.

1 east wheelbarrow stone tool wall~
The eastern wall here is decorated by a polka-dot pattern of fresh mortar

that is much lighter than the the earthen background.  Sitting amidst the

shadows of the wall is a very large wheelbarrow, filled with some

cinder-blocks.  Laying in the dust and peices of broken blocks in the

wheelbarrow is a metal spade, a fine tool of masonry.

Along the Wall~
In the golden shadow of the illuminating monstrosity to the west, the

strange omniscent feelings of previous parts of this place subside...a

little.  With such a marvelous glow, a certain serenity is established,

such as those with holy places.  The building stands pretty high,

probably twenty feet tall or more.  Tall grasses of at least a foot or

two brush the smooth, golden walls.  About five feet from the ground, a

ruby-red rectangle is fitted into the side.  Within the bounds of it are

intricate carvings of old runes, no clue to their meaning visible. 

Crowding the ruby-red rectangle, all over the wall from what you can see

are punctilious enscribings.  The eastern wall here is back to it's usual

run-down state, somethin you are more used to looking at than the

unusally brighter, well-kept section of wall a bit north of here.

1 west golden building~
Westward, towering before you with certain sublimity, is the hard to miss

golden building that is a definite attention-getter.  This either the

east or west side of it, no entrance is visible, but you do notice a

strange @rred@n rectangle on the side here.  Everywhere around the

@rred@n rectangle though that you can see, are strange carvings made in

the wall.  All the way to the near ground, the wall is covered in this

expansive enigma, which probably took quite a bit of work.

Along the Wall~
A good ways from the northern wall now, the golden building that has been

gleaming and shimmering in the distance is now very close.  Appearing

quite magnificent, the golden walls of the building are nearly blinding

from certain angles -- quite a sight.  The eastern wall, in this part, does

not seem as badly damaged as other parts.  The slate-colored stone is

actually pretty light, showing no signs of charring, and structurally the

wall seems almost entirely intact save for a small fissure or two

stemming from the top.  South the path along the wall continues, basking

in the golden glory casted by the marveling beauty of a building

that rises beside it.  Back north for a good walk or so, the dirt path

follows up to where it meets the northern wall, with clumps of grass

scattered about.  West a smaller road leads further into the northern

side of the behemoth of gold.

golden building 1 west~
Laying a bit to the southwest is the aureate structure that is sure to

catch anyone's attention Crafted from what appears to be solid gold, it

emits an un-earthy glow.  No entrance can be seen from this angle, but

surely there is a way in, for if there is gold on the outside, one has to

wonder -what- could be on the inside.

1 eastern wall slate-colored~
The eastern wall which is earthen and ashen in most parts, in part

because of inflicted destruction, is much different here.  Here it stands

with a slate hue, or even lighter like a wet stone.  No signs of real

damage or charring are visible for the most part, though near the top a

couple small cracks zig-zag their way down before stopping near the

middle.

Along the Wall~
In need of much repair, the cinereous and battered eastern wall looks

like it has been through hell.  The crumbled ruins fall only half as high

as the rebuilt or untouched parts of the original wall.  The curvacity of

the damage and structural arrangement of the destruction leads a person

to possibly believe magic.  In contrast to the wary eastern ruins that

whispers death in a dusty, crippled voice, to the west there lies a

magnificent tree.  Appearing to be a type of oak, it towers probably

fifty feet or more easily.  Along the wall, the path continues south for

a good ways, while in the opposite direction it follows until it hits the

north wall.  The tree to the west blocks any passage that way.

Unblemished bark of deep silver and favilla, the entirety of the tree is

contrarily untouched by any sign of destruction unlike the wall not feet

away from it.  Whoever caused the destruction in the wall had no

intentions of hurting this oaken marvel.  The limbs soar above head,

casting stick-figure shadows on the ground that dance around you in a sun

ritual.

1 east wall ruins~
Falling in a crumbled heap, the earth-colored wall is speckled with

peices of ash and soot, as it flows gently to the ground like a foot hill. 

As bad as the destruction may seem, a pattern in it is faintly detectable

by a trained eye when examined more closely.  An ellipse of some sort can

be seen, a pattern too obvious once noticed to be caused by a brute force. 

No, this is definitely the work of magic.  Force combined with discipline

and similiarity.

Backyard~
The yard here seems darker than in other parts, scorched and burned. 

Blades of grass and other plant life that was once former greenery has

been incenerated in earth-scorching heats, forming piles of ash and burnt

grass around the open area.  To the west, the backyard area continues,

looking burned nearly as bad as here.  North and south follow alongside

the eastern wall of charred gray stone.

The former greenery here is burned into smaller peiecs, and lay like

helpless artifacts upon the dark, ashen earth holding their stories of

once torrid attacks that caused such damage.  Most of the grasses lay in

burnt heaps blown softly by the cool breezes, spreading the dirty soot

Backyard~
The field opens up here, as it moves away from the building to the south

and statues to the west.  The grasses grow quite short, possibly freshly

cut.  The smell of smoke is heavy here, and you notice a mound of ashes

laying a bit to the side, probably the burned remains of once high

grasses.  A few charred areas of ground are noticeable, but not as many

as other places have, leading you to believe this is one of the more

undisturbed parts.  A quaint looking birdbath, made of a very light-gray

stone is standing on a small hill, and something appears to be in it,

though not moving, so probably not a bird.

birdbath~
The birdbath standing atop a small hill is made of a smooth looking stone

that is gray in color.  It has a base with about a half-foot diameter

that leads to the bowl part which is probably a good two to three feet in

diameter, and a quarter of a foot deep.  The water inside the bath

appears steel-gray and almost shiny, quite odd indeed.  Inside, you

notice the hideous, rotting corpse of what was once a bird of

considerable portions, probably a crow.  The smell is disgusting, as well

as the sight -- the bird appears to be layed on its side, a few feathers

poking out in random directions, and maggots crawling out of the abdomen

area and onto the rib bones which appear very white, like every scrap of

flesh was eaten off.  The intense eyes of the now dead beast stare at you

with intense distaste, making you blink to reassure yourself it is dead.

~
E
grasses~
The grasses here are barely an inch or two off the ground, possibly

because they were freshly cut, because in other places the grasses was

noticeable higher.  Spots of black show where damage probably by an

intense flare of heat had occured, but they are not as common here as in

other places, especially those that can be seen even from here on the

east wall and below it.

Backyard -- Near a Statue~
A proud statue stands near here, one of an ethereal looking figure.  The

image glows and flickers as it dances, hardly looking solid.  The figure

is an evil looking man, dressed in black, and his fiery eyes are very

noticeable.  Near to the statue, on the ground not far from here, is a

chisel.  All around the statue, and even covering the chisel is a fine

black powder, probably from the sculpting of the base of the statue, as

the statue the more you look at it does not look like it was carved from

rock.  A branch in the dirt path leads directly south of here, to the

steps of a magnificient golden building.  Not far to the north is the

north wall, looking reasonably intact.

A haunting statue that appears to almost be two-dimensional, seems to

float above a finely carved black base.  The figure is cloaked in black,

and his fiery eyes are quite vivid and visible, looking like orbs of pure

flame.  He himself carries a wicked grin.  He surely does not look like

the kind of person you would like to see alone late at nite on a street

corner in Medienne.

E
chisel~
A small chisel, no more than three-quarters of a foot long, lies on the

ground, collecting the black dust that has fallen and scattered about the

ground here while the base for the statue was made.  A simple wooden

handle of maple, and a metal body, it looks like a fine tool of the

trade, making it odd that someone would leave it.

Due south of here, a la a narrow dirt path, is the front of a building

made of solid gold.  The front steps lead up to a pair of brilliant white

doors.  Marble columns stand majestically on each side.  If it looks

anything on the inside like the outside, then this surely is a place of

sheer luxury.

Backyard -- Before a Towering Statue~
The air here is so thick and heavy that it is nearly impossible to

breathe, so permeated is it with evil.  Standing tall and proud to the

south is what can only be described as a statue created out of a sheer

void of matter, Neither metals nor stone can be seen and no evidence of

any mortal hand in its creation.  The void is at once a fathomless depth

and merely two dimensional, though during its imperceptible shift between

these two extremes it seems to remain constant in its shape of a hooded

man.  Set just below the edge of the hood are a pair of burning orbs that

mimic eyes in this dark creation, leading one to believe, if rumors are

true, that this is a statue of the dreaded Morkith.

Backyard -- Near a Statue~
Figures rise up from the level ground both to the east and south,

appearing to be magnificently built statues at first glance.  Obviously

these creations were carved from a uniformly black material as evidenced

by both their absorption of light and the fine black powder evidenced on

the ground.  The air is heavy almost as if an otherworldly weight were

pushing down on it; the feelings of evil are so prominent that it seems

to almost be a physical manifestation.  A small pathway appears to the

west heading both far deeper into the compounds heart or directly towards

a soaring archway.

Dull, tarnished gold climbs skyward to the east creating the outside wall

of a large building.  Set more than seven feet high into the wall is a

large, arched, partially intact window, the wrought iron of its framework

visible evidencing the reason for its strength and durability.  Intricate

carvings cover nearly every available inch of the golden exterior,

apparently the etchings are some sort of flowing script.  A field of

dried grass edges up to the wall of the golden building and stretches

towards the gravel pathway to the west.

Covering every available inch of the golden walls, the carvings are

whole wall, although it is difficult to tell if they are on the parts

The path of rocks and dirt follows alongside a beautiful building of gold

north and south, curving around to the adjacent sides.  The base of the

wall of the golden building here has a few tufts of grass growing a foot

or so in the air, and at about this height, no farther up, the gold

appears a bit more orange and tarnished looking.  A flowing script is

visible from the highest point to down into the parts where the grass

brushes, covering the building entirely.  The script is intrcately carved

and the symbols and shapes seem to have definite pattern, like a runic

alphabet.

Wrapping around the entirety of the building, from the tip-top peak

The path is quite wide before it disappears into the grasses on one side,

bit moist.

Solid gold soars skyward to the east creating the outer wall of a large

building.  At the base of the wall the gold is a tarnished, slightly dull

brown, but transforms to a startalingly vibrant yellow near the top. 

Intricate carvings cover nearly every available inch of the golden

exterior, obviously the etching are some sort of flowing script.  Set

more than seven feet above the ground, a large arched window, complete

with a stylized wrought iron frame is the only break in the story-telling

runes.  A short distance to the north a pair of large statues can be

seen, while to the west a pathway is evident paralleling the walls of the

golden structure.

Smoke wafts skyward from the glowing braziers that stand at the front

side of each of the demonic statues.  Remarkably even the back of these

statues shows an exquisite workmanship hinting at their true value.  A

short distance to the southeast a massive building of what appears to be

solid gold soars heavanward, reaching skyward in what seems to be an

attempt to stand taller than the outer walls.

Broken chisels, hammers and other stoneworking equipment lies strewn

about the sparse grass leading up to two malevolent looking statues. 

Coupled with the useless tools are literally hundreds of pounds of black

opal lying about, both in large chunks and merely dust confirming that

not only are these newly created but works in progress.  Glowing braziers

light the area surrounding the twin statues, casting strange flickering

shadows to dance across the opal surface enhancing the near-perceptible

radiation of evil emanating from the dark forms.  What appears to be

another statue, or more like a blackness that mimics a statue stands just

a short distance to he northeast.

broken chisels hammers stoneworking sparse grass tools useless large chunks opal~
Laying in cluttered heaps, the latest in expensive sculpting tools are

scattered about the lawn admist sparse patches of grass.  Fine, shiny

chisels, large and sturdy hammers, and a few other items to make the

roughest of form into a lifelike, silken figure with superfluous amounts

of meticulous details.  Beneath the statues are large chunks of the black

opal these figures are carved out of, the source of all the handy-work. 

At the bases, occasional pieces of opal dust get lifted in the wind from

the mounds of dust they once were apart of.  The tools were left here as

if dropped suddenly, as they do not look neatly arranged.  Yet, such nice

tools would probably have been covered in sheathing or brought in to

avoid rust or damage if the person using them had not rushed off so

suddenly, as it appears.  They are still here though, and the statues are

still a bit unfinished, so it is obvious it is a work and progress and

will be attented to when possible.

Backyard -- Some High Grasses Near the Hedges~
Blades of grass taller than most dwarves grow in lazy bunches and cover

most of the ground here, making it quite hard to see in front of you, let

alone your feet.  A chilling breeze blows briskly, rustling the blades to

tickle and annoy anyone progressing through their thickness.  The west

wall of the complex rises high just a few yards from here, which is not

too far from the north wall that is seen a good walk from here.  A wall

of hedges is seen over the grass west of here, forming a long row growing

north until it hits a bend in the western wall, and also heading south

for a good ways.  Standing around taking in the surroundings does not

last long, as the breeze gets colder, almost enough to cause one to tuck

their arms inside clothing to keep warm.

Backyard -- Along a Wall of Hedges~
The grasses are much shorter here, barely reaching the knees.  The

destruction is far greater, large patches of former grass, now black

ashes on the ground.  The lifeless landscape here, combined with the cold

winds blowing at your face and ears, makes this an unplesant spot. 

Adding to the sense of despair are a pair of statues crafted of black to

the east, their faces showing expressions of hate.  To the west a thick

row of hedges lines the path, blocking all passage.  The path goes either

north or south along the hedges, or east where it eventually comes to the

statues.

A wall of hedges, as tall as an ogre, lines the path to the west, making

through them.

Backyard -- Along a Wall of Hedges~
The wall of hedges to the west grows the same enormous width and height

all the way until the end, where it stops at the wooden building south of

here, pressing upon the wall firmly.  It follows back north for a good

ways, but a break can be seen where the west wall makes a turn, the path

winding around it.  A golden building, much bigger than the one south of

here, lies on the eastern landscape, reflecting bits of light in an

almost blinding array.  South of here a building of dark wood is

noticeable, the path here following around it.

Hedges as tall as a large orc, or maybe even taller, and of an

way.  A deep hunter green in external color, the internal network of

thorny branches is brown, and very little patches of light can be seen

indicating the other side, it is so thick.

Made of dark wood, the building rises probably twenty feet in the air,

building.

Backyard -- Behind a Towering Statue~
The air itself here is heavy in the shadow of not only two but three

towering statues that radiate evil.  A short distance to the southwest a

pair of statues stand tall seemingly rising out of the ground itself,

while to the north a statue that seems to be part of another, more

sinister world stands.  While only the back of the statue to the north is

evident, its construction is still a marvel, seemingly not made of stone

or metal, but instead crafted out of a sheer void of matter; It is at

once a fathomless depth and two-dimensional.

Backyard -- Near the Golden Building~
A few small trees have begun to take root in the shadows of the large

golden building to the south.  The small trees are numerous enough to

force you to walk around them in an effort to reach the white marble

stairs just a short distant to the east.  Further hindering their growth,

a pair of towering statues, newly built, to the northwest blocks even

more of the life-giving rays that these trees thrive on.  The golden

walls are inscribed from top to bottom, seemingly in one flowing script

that wraps around the building, the only break in their lines is a window

set quite a distant up on the wall.

Before the Grand Library~
A long line of steps lead up to a pair of shiny doors set into the front

of the golden building that appears to be a library.  The steps seem to

have been carved directly out of a gigantic slab of pure white marble, as

no seam nor mortar joints can be seen.  A large open book has been

inscribed just above the doors, dwarfing the rest of the neat

inscriptions that have been carved into the golden surface.  The carvings

appear to be some sort of flowing script, as there is a definite pattern

to their curves.

Backyard -- Near the Golden Building~
Rising up towards a pair of shiny metal doors, a solid white marble

stairway blocks any movement to the west.  Neither seams nor mortar

joints can be seen in its construction, though a large fissure appears to

have begun creeping up its lenghts from the ground up.  The stairway

itself is dwarfed by the building that it leads up to, a towering and yet

elegant building fashioned out of what appears to be solid gold.  Every

square inch of the building is covered in inscriptions, save for a large

rectangular window set halfway up the walls height.  The carvings are in

a flowing pattern, which even though you are unable to read immediately

strikes you as being a form of written language.

Visions of contradicting proportions rise up out of the ground in all

directions.  To the south a mammoth building crafted out of solid gold

brings warmth to anyone resting his or her eyes on its almost blinding

glory.  To the southwest and northwest three statues of pure black stand

darkening their surroundings and radiating a perceptible veil of evil. 

To the east, quite a distance off stands a magnificent oak; growing to

heights that dwarf even the outer walls of the compound.  Yet another

reminder that nature will not only rival but will defeat anything man

could make in beauty.

Backyard~
In plain view to the west, rising probably eight feet or so, a mysterious

statue of something definitely not human is apparent.  It flickers a bit,

and has an ethereal quality to it, raising the interest of anyone who

lays eyes upon it.  Rising high enough to the south to block view of

almost anything else in that direction, is a spectacular building of gold

with two beautiful white doors visible even from here.  The battered and

scorched wall to the east is a dull, earthen color, and when looked upon

as a whole reflects a tired, jaded look -- it has probably been through a

lot.  The path meanders in different directions; west it leads to the

statue, south to the golden building, and northeast to the east wall. 

Rising high to the east, blocking all passage, a magnificient tree that

is definitely a hard-wood, maybe an oak or elm, looks in unusually well

health.

At this distance, a lot can be noticed of the eastern wall.  For one, it

very black and charred.  The high ramparts are crumbling in places,

making the wall-tops look hazardous.  A few fissures from the ground rise

up into it, indicating maybe an intense shaking of some sort took place

perhaps, in order to cause such cracks.

A large, impressive tapestry hangs along the eastern wall of this room,

its picture catching much attention.  The gold of the walls is tarnished

to a dull bronze color by the smoke and ash, though surprisingly, little

else in the room shows any signs of devastation.  Marble shelves line the

north and south walls, the books and scrolls they bear showing no signs

of destruction at all.  Colored patterns of light dance across the floor,

a glance towards the ceiling revealing the source of the mosaic of light

to be a large skylight of stained glass.  Comfortable chairs are placed

about the room, providing a cozy resting place for any wishing to browse

the knowledge held within these walls.  An intricately carved golden

archway leads to the entranceway towards the west.

tapestry~
A very large tapestry, woven of the finest silks, linens, and cottons,

hangs lazily on the eastern wall, covering most of it.  The tapestry's

background is midnight black, making the foreground colors vivid and real. 

The scene is two figures, dark and terrifying.  One has horns, the other

has eyes of pure fire.  Both are cloaked in black, and both are carrying

wicked grins.  Together they raise their hands to the sky, near to each

other, where a crackling ball of lightning is floating and rolling in the

sparkling ethereal air, anxiously waiting to be unleashed on an unlucky

victim.  Above them, the upper half of a figure is visible, and it is

obvious the designer tried to make it appear as if it were translucent. 

The figure has eyes even more fiery and red than the figures below it,

and a look more evil than the pair's combined.  The pale moon at the peak

of the weaving lines the iridescent evil figures, their nefarious auras

shining black and deep red in its dull glow.  Barely noticeable when

glancing at the moon are two craters, and then below a series of smaller

ones, that if looked upon just right, almost appear to be two eyes and a

mouth, but those of a skull.  The entire scene is one of extreme evil and

hate.  At the bottom, stitched neatly in yellow is the letter M, and

under it AH.

Speckles of light dance on the floor of the room, dancing on the books

you with warm feelings.

favorite manuscript.

Polished arches of gold frame the entrance to the east.  The gold plating

of the walls has been stripped away in several places, revealing the

smooth white marble beneath.  The deep sapphire blue carpets are somewhat

singed, as though embers of flame had fallen, yet quickly put out.  Along

the western wall, a window seat once provided patrons of this library a

cozy nook in which to read or enjoy a view of the lovely courtyard,

though now, only a vista of desolation is visible.  Globes of soft white

mage-light provide a soft glow to illuminate the area, their gleam

reflected in the golden panels of the walls.  Several small tables lie

about the room, various books and scrolls lying open upon them.  A faint,

musty smell of ancient tomes lingers in the air.

Heavy draperies of the finest sapphire velvet hang artistically around

create a private, cozy nook in which to read and study the many ancient

manuscripts this library has to offer.  Several of the panes of glass

Simple wooden tables, chestnut in color, are neatly positioned about the

Library Hall~
Two immense pillars of black marble rise gracefully to the vaulted

ceiling on either side of this elegant hallway.  The walls are plated

with pure gold, carved with the intricate runic script, though often the

gold has been chipped away, revealing the alabaster-white stone beneath. 

Plush sapphire blue carpeting lines the hallway under your footsteps,

cushioning them.  Several ivory pedestals stand sentinel on both sides of

the hall, though all of them bear some signs of discoloration from heat

and smoke.  The statuary upon the pedestals is demonic in nature,

portraying all manner of imps and devils, and quite out of place in what

was once a refuge of elegant serenity.  Silver archways mark the entrance

to rooms on the east and west, though the delicate filigree carvings

which once adorned them are badly scarred by scratches and gaping holes

where once gemstones were set.

Slender ivory pedestals, quite obviously a remnant of days long since

faded away, adorn the hallway.  The normal creamy white color of the

ivory is darkened to a heavy, dull brown shade, though near the bottom,

the white color is still clear.  On each pedestal sits a devilish imp,

carved of a deep ebony stone.  The pose each figure holds is unique, but

all share the same mischievous grin The statue's eyes are set with

flaming red gems, which glitter brilliantly in any light.

pillars~
Elegant columns of blackest marble, smooth and cold to the touch, rise

all the way to the ceiling high above, but do not seem to be supporting

it in anyway.  Curiously red veins run through the marble, giving these

pillars an otherworldly look.  The columns are gracefully designed, the

stone from which they are carved completely without flaw or blemish. 

Near the top of each pillar, a demonic face has been carved, each with a

disconcertingly evil leer forever frozen in the chill stone.

Gleaming silver forms arches leading to the east and west.  The archways

themselves are beautifully carved with a pattern of intertwining roses

and ivies.  A glint of crystal sparkles here and there on the carved

leaves, perhaps meant to represent new-fallen dew on a fresh morning. 

Many of the delicate crystals have been gouged away, however, and the

intricate rose pattern is heavily marred by deep scratches where hunks of

the silver metal have been clawed away.

Library Room~
The devastation in this room is almost breathtaking.  Splinters of

furniture litter the floor, which is nearly stripped of its once plush

carpeting.  Shattered glass is strewn about the floor, and it looks

rather as if an explosion had gone off in the center of the room.  In a

couple places along the walls, the golden plating seems melted slightly,

with tiny rivulets of the metal running down the wall like blood from an

angry wound.  Books and scrolls are scattered haphazardly upon the

blackened shelves, several of them singed and partially burned.  Several

shelves of manuscripts lean heavily against the walls, their battered

frames seeming too weary to stand unaided.  The bookcase on the southern

wall, however, seems perfectly intact, with most of the books it bears

neatly arranged.  Strangely out of place amidst the destruction, sparkles

of colored light dance a merry pattern upon the chaos, streaming in from

the stained glass skylight above.

stained glass skylight sparkles~
The stained glass of the skylight above seems to hold no particular

pattern, merely a mosaic of light and color.  The colors of the glass are

brilliant and vivid, and the light that filters through is shaded with

all the hues of a pouch of sparkling gems.  Dapples of light play across

the horrific destruction, the simple beauty of their many tones a grim

paradox with the shattered ruins.

~
E
walls metal gold~
The gold plating of the walls is completely melted through in several

areas, revealing wide expanses of the stone beneath.  Rivulets of the

metal have solidified into golden tears, as if the walls themselves weep

for the destruction wrought within.

~
E
1 south bookcase~
Taking up a considerable portion of the south wall of this room in the

library is a large bookcase, built into the wall itself.  The case stands

around ten feet high, and though much of the rest of the room is in utter

chaos, this bookcase alone seems untouched by the wanton destruction. 

The tomes it bears are all intact and neatly aligned on their shelves,

with the exception of one @rred@n volume, which is pulled out just a bit

beyond the others.  The bookshelf otherwise appears perfect, with not

even a trace of dust to mar its polished surface.

~
E
red~
Merely a simple @rred@n book, this particular tome is really no different

in size or shape than the others on its shelf.  Even its crimson color is

not unique; there appear to be quite a few red books.  This one, however,

is not perfectly aligned with every other volume, but rather it protrudes

a few inches, as though a careless reader pulled it out a bit for later

study, or perhaps neglected to push it into alignment with the others.

Library Room~
Row upon row of shelves fill this room, each stacked with many scrolls

and tomes containing the knowledge of years past.  Though many of the

room's once elegant furnishings have been singed by flames, the

manuscripts themselves are strangely untouched, surviving the chaos to

which the rest of the room seems to have subjected.  Once beautiful

wall-hangings have been ripped to shreds by knives and other weaponry and

replaced with hideous banners of ebony and crimson bearing the crest of

Morkith.  Even the mage-lights which light the area seem to flicker as if

shamed to look upon the destruction which was wreaked upon this place. 

Several scrolls lie open on the burned and battered tables, giving

evidence of recent study.

wall-hangings hangings~
Very little of these hangings remains intact, the heavy silk of which

they are made shredded by an angry force.  Tattered remnants still droop

pitifully from the walls, though they are all but eclipsed by the large,

glaring banners of Morkith.

~
E
banners crest~
The banners are woven of only the best quality silks.  Blacker than a

starless midnight is the background, the color so intense that it seems

to literally absorb the light surrounding it into its own evil depths.  A

flaming crimson skull leers out from this mire of purest ebon, the

dancing tongues of flame surrounding it seeming to move and glisten with

their own unnatural glow.

~
E
shelves~
The shelves are made of a light, amber colored wood, polished to such a

high gloss as to rival the very walls of gold with their radiant shine. 

Scrolls and manuscripts in every known language, indeed, even several

written in dialects now lost to the passage of time, neatly line the

amber shelves, catagorized by subject.  The elegant, archaic script which

covers the outside of the library is also quite prevalent on these

shelves, perhaps giving reference to the contents of these tomes.

Library Hall~
A carved ivory curio cabinet dominates the wall to the south.  Neatly

arranged on the shelves behind its glass doors are many rare and precious

artifacts, and manuscripts which appear so ancient as to crumble at the

lightest touch.  Soft mage-lights cast a gentle glow upon these

treasures, illuminating them as they nestle into the soft black velvet in

which they are cased.  A pair of hideous gargoyles perch atop black

marble columns, one on either side of the hallway, their evil leers quite

unsettling.  Intricately carved arches of silver open up to the east and

west.

Two perfectly devilish gargoyles grin down over the room from their

perches high atop the columns of stone.  The creatures are quite large,

each almost the size of a dwarf or halfling.  Masterfully sculpted wings

arch over the hunched, deformed looking backs, and thin lips are pulled

back from a mouthful of sharp fangs in a demonic grin.  The gargoyles are

formed from an ebony stone which seems almost to pull away the

surrounding light to forever drown in its depths of blackness.

Silver archways open to the east and west, allowing entrance to more of

the library's study room.  The gleaming metal seems carved from one large

block of silver, as there are no visible seams in the arches.  An

intricate pattern of intertwined roses and ivy leaves decorates the

elegant doorways, the delicate filigree scarely damaged save for the fact

that many of the faceted crystals which once adorned the leaves have been

pried away.

Library Room~
A plush, beautifully woven rug carpets this room in soft luxury.  Shelves

of polished amber colored wood line the walls, each bearing many tomes of

ancient lore.  Several of the shelves are blackened a little by the touch

of flames, though the books themselves are carefully preserved. 

Prominently displayed on the northern wall is the midnight black banner

of Morkith, the lava-red eyes of the crimson skull it bears ever vigilant

in their unsleeping watch.  In one corner of the room, a few potted

plants once grew, though these have long since withered from neglect. 

The musical sound of babbling water trickles from beside the plants, its

source a small marble fountain.

banner~
The banner is rather large, its blazing presence one of the most easily

noticed things in this otherwise quite demure room.  A flaming skull

glares down from a sea of deepest black velvet, an evil grin on its

skeletal face.  The banner is edged by a border of pure gold thread, its

glittering color a stark contrast to the field of midnight it surrounds. 

Golden threads also border the tongues of flame embroidered around the

crimson skull, outlining them in an almost life-like fashion.

~
E
plants~
What types of plants once grew in this secluded corner is difficult to be

certain now, so faded and withered is their foilage.  The cerulean blue

and gold urns in which the plants once flourished are cracked and faded

now, their prettily painted designs barely discernable beneath a layer of

grim.  A few brown and dying leaves still cling tenaciously to the

sketetal remains of the plants, and many more litter the floor around the

ceramic urns.  Oddly enough, one deep crimson flower grows in the very

center of the dying mess of vegetation, untouched by the decay.  The

single blossom is elegant in its simplicity, its petals velvety soft and

fairly glowing with health.

Library Room~
An ivory and gold border runs along the top of the walls, bearing the

elegant script in a continuous legend around the room.  Many tall shelves

of glossy amber colored wood fill the area, each holding quite a few

scrolls and tomes, the lore of times long past.  Soft mage-lights provide

illumination for anyone wishing to read or study, the glow they cast

never glaring, but always providing ample light.  A large windowed panel

ran across the western wall at one time, however nearly every pane of the

glass has been broken, the shattered fragments littering the soft

sapphire carpeting.  Pieces of pastel colored silks are strewn around

randomly, evidence of a tapestry, perhaps, or a set of draperies which

once graced this chamber.

The bordered panel is about a foot in height, and reaches all the way

yellowed with age, though still a creamy white color.  An inlay of golden

The western wall of this chamber is panelled almost completely in glass,

though the majority of the panels have been shattered, leaving only

jagged fragments of glass in the frames.  The beautiful vista of the

courtyard which was visible from this room is also ruined, for now only

the chaos is present.  In the corner of one of the broken glass panels, a

spider has made its home, spinning a heavy web in its isolation.

Along the Wall~
The sense of apprehension is strong, as the path makes a perpendicular

corner in the north west part of the compound.  Feelings of mistakeness

accompanied with being watched fill the mind.  The road is quite in the

open here, much of the compound visible.  Dirt flies up loosely from the

path here, blowing and spinning against the western wall.  To the south

the path disappears around a corner to the west.  The path continues

eastward for a good ways, the eastern wall barely visible in the distance. 

The trees that bordered the west wall do not seem to be present on the

north wall, as the area along the northern walls seems to have been a bit

more put to use.

The norther wall junctions with the wester wall, coming to a

The winds pick up a bit, getting quite strong.  The stronger winds cut

through the air with a frightening smoothness, making light whistling

sounds that resemble a laugh.  The sheer openness of the road present a

feeling of maybe being watched?  or insecurity?

Along the wall~
The path continues here along the northern wall both east and west for a

good ways.  To the west, an inlet in the wall is noticeable, perhaps an

opening to the outside.  If it was not already cold enough, a sharp wind

occasionally stirs, causing chills.  Near the north wall, a skull is

faintly detectable beneath some dirt with a few bones scattered around it. 

Flies buzz about in their usual manner, but their incessant buzzing seems

to irritate the mind more than normal, like they are purposely being

annoying.  To the south, most of the The Training Grounds complex can be

seen, although hardly detailed from this distance.

skull bone flies~
A half broken skull is buried partly in the dirt, actually more like

lodged there.  It appears to be that of an elf or something of that size,

but at this point it is hard to tell.  A fly or three lands on it, but

find nothing worthy of their presence.  Scattered around the skull are

bits and peices of bones, none near whole.  The bones look extremely

shattered, probably accomplished with considerable force.

1 west inlet opening~
A passage to the outside perhaps, an inlet is definitely present further

west in the wall, but set in a bit much to tell quite what it is. 

Squinting, light seems to sparkle from this area, possibly indicating

some time of glass?

1 south~
Southward lies a few buildings that come into sight, though not much else

can be ascertained about them but a rough estimate in their size, or at

least in comparison to one another.  One of the buildings though, seems

to shine a bit, reflecting any light.

Along the wall~
The area here is not at ground level, but rather built up a good three

feet, creating a nice, gentle slope.  Atop the summit, combined with the

openness of the area, you can actually see much of the compound, at least

better than other areas this far north.  The building off to the south

west seems much simpler and darker.  To the west, the path continues

along the northern wall.  East the path continues for a bit, but the

eastern wall can be seen in the distance.  South lies the open dirt and

grass areas of the compound.

ground level slope summit~
At least three feet higher here than the ground level, a good sized mound

of dirt has been built up against the wall, creating a small hill.  The

ground here is hard, packed down well when the mound was built up. 

Standing at it's peak, a slightly better view of the area can be obtained

then the one just at ground level.  Of course, even with the hill at the

wall, reaching the top of these immensely high walls is not even close.

Along the wall~
Still following along the north wall, the actual vastness of this

compound is becoming more and more apparent.  There seems to be more

evidence of life here, contrary to most of the path along the north wall,

shown by a few insects moving about and some scattered prints of smaller

animals.  Mainly it is a row of ants attracted around something dead,

something food here, heading south probably to their hill.  A few claw

prints are slewn about the path, probably those of a racoon or stray cat. 

To the east the path continues, nearing the eastern wall.  To the west,

the wall there can still be seen but growing farther and farther away. 

Due south a shiny, probably metallic structure is visible.

evidence life insects scattered prints animals ants dead claw prints racoon stray cat~
Near your feet, a row of ants, two actually, form in and out-going lanes

of insect traffic.  Moving quite speedily, they seem to be attracted

around something dead, probably a millipede or worm, which is now food. 

On the opposite side of the path of the ants, the northern side, is a few

claw prints a bit out of place.  Probably those of a stray cat or racoon,

as they appear to have sharp points, they are rather small and do not

seem to lead anywhere, as if the creature made it up the wall from this

point.  But no feline or racoon, no matter how dextrous or graceful,

could scale these colossal walls.

Along the wall~
The north wall proceeds onward, growing closer to the intersection lying

to the east.  Lined up against the gray stone are barrels of various

sizes and shapes, some are cracked and broken, some are without a lid. 

Scattered randomly about the ground a handful of burlap bags, looking

mostly empty, lie in crumpled heaps.  The ash colored northern wall and

path that parallels it continue to the west for a good ways, and eastard

to thatside of the complex, where it makes a turn to the south.

barrels burlap bags~
Lined up against the gray stone wall to the north are a cluster of

barrels.  Most a different shape and size than the previous, they appear

to be quite used, as some appear broken or cracked from abuse and age.  A

few have lids missing, but it is impossible to tell if something is in or

was in their shadowy depths.  About the bottom of the barrels are an

assortment of bags, appearing to be burlap, all empty it seems.  The

purpose of the bags or barrels is a mystery unrevealed by anything you

can see with your eyes.

Along the wall~
Just as the end of the path seemed in sight, it runs into the

perpendicular junction of the eastern and northern wall, where it curves

south and follows along the large, gray mass of stone that makes up the

eastern side of the complex.  The intersection of the two ashen palings

is marked by bits of fallen rock and damage, showing a bit of destruction. 

Criss-crossing beams of repair work scaffolding make their way up the

wall, signs of rebuilding what was probably at one time worse than this,

but is in the process of getting better.  Off to the west, the north wall

continues for as far as the eye can see.  Southward the path follows

alongside the eastern wall for as far as you can tell.

Westward the dirt path flows alongside the north wall for a considerable

North of a Quartz Gate~
You stand before a gateway carved directly into earthen-colored walls

that spread out to both the east and west.  The gate is not immense by

any standards, just allowing a person on horseback to clear the archway,

though not tall the gateway is wide allowing for the passage of large

wagons.  A pair of crystalline doors poised within the archway hang as if

by magic, as no hinges can be seen nor any other mechanical device which

could open and close these crystalline doors.  The doors are covered in

dark smudges reminescent of the after affects of great magical fires,

coupled with this are long gashes physically hacked into the quartz.

Wide gashes mar the once-smooth surface of these massive doors, leaving

the impression of great force being applied to the gate.  Covered in a

sooty by product of fire, the gates seem to have done their job in

defending the compound.  The stone's integrity has been uncompromized,

and the twin quartz doors still hang as if by magic.

Beside the Wall~
Standing in the southwestern corner of the compound, a wall rises both to

the south and the west.  Chiseled directly into the western is a narrow

stairway, leading steeply to the top of the ramparts.  Moss covers most

of the staircase in dull, green patches unbroken by any footprints,

indicating that not oft in recent years have any made this ascent. 

Sporadic crumbling of some of the steps shows a slow deterioration in

this part of the complex.

walls stone~
The stone that makes up these seamless walls is the exact color of the

ground underfoot.  The complete lack of seams in the towering walls

combined with this perfect color gives a very strong impression that the

walls were forced from the earth itself by powerful magicks.

E
long staircase green moss steps crumbling~
Expertly crafted into the walls of the compound, the stairway rises

steeply to the ramparts.  Shallow risers and narrow treads make footing

difficult at best, and nearly impossible to wage a battle on.  Now, with

crumbling steps and covered with slick patches of moss, it would be even

more difficult, giving the defenders a decided advantage should the

ramparts be compromised.

Behind the Tower~
A soaring tower of seamless ivory rises to the east, stretching far into

the sky.  Covering the first twenty feet of so of the pearlescent wall,

numerous deep scratches and patches of black soot mar the pristine

surface.  Jutting from the alabaster wall near the top of the tower, a

balcony offers a panoramic view of the surrounding compound.  Centered at

the pinnacle of the spire, an old rune has been cut into the smooth,

polished stone-like substance.  To the west lies the earthen-colored

stone wall that borders the complex.

The color of a midsummer's day cloud, the rising walls of the ivory tower

Beside the Wall~
Rising more than twenty feet into the air, the outer wall of the compound

turns sharply to the east, throwing long shadows across the dusty,

near-barren soil.  Here the wall is heavily damaged, quite unlike other

more sturdy sections that have withstood the test of time.  One

particularly large area seems to have melted, the flow of molten rock

oozing toward the ground to solidify at ground level into a sloping mound

of stone.

A part of the wall seems to have been super-heated by some impossibly hot

Balcony~
Staring out over the balcony, a majestic view is evident all around.  The

tower reaches just slightly higher than the outer wall allowing any

viewer to see out over the wall and stare out at the skyline itself.  No

ground is evident beyond the walls giving the eerie impression that the

stronghold is floating in mid-air.  Looking back at the tower, an

intricate rune has been carved directly at the apex of the arch leading

to the inside, though an errant arrow has pentrated the exact center of

this arcane symbol, forever destroying its consistency.  The ground

beneath the balcony is far below, making a fall not particurally deadly

but very painful none the less.

What this rune may have once been used for is a mystery, though a few

leads one to believe that perhaps this rune may have once protected

anyone inside the room from outside attacks.

Along the Ramparts~
In an odd contrast, the ramparts here appear to have seen no action in

previous battles, while to the south the wall is all but breached, with a

large chunk of it completely blown away.  Perhaps the lack of damage to

the wall is due to this segment of the wall being out of range of any war

machines which could have been moved along the road to the southeast. 

The ground outside of the wall here is fairly wide, vectoring as it is

out towards the road, and at the same time in towards the extreme

northeastern corner of this compound.  The roof-top roadway is blocked to

the south by a gaping hole where the wall was breached, the only way

across would be a death-defying leap though the path to the north is

still accessible.

From the dizzying heights of the wall you can see the broken ground below.

Along the Ramparts~
Obvious repair work has been recently finished in this section of the

wall, little to no effort having been made in covering up the fact. 

Fresh mortar, a pale gray in color stands out against the standard dark

earthen-colored rock of the original wall.  The mortar was not applied in

any semblence of neatness, but instead slathered about the wall anywhere

even a small fissure was evident.  This section of the wall offers a

beautiful view of the golden building within the compound proper just to

the east, the wall being close enough to almost allow a daredevil to leap

to its roof.

The original stones of the wall have been buried under an impressive

amount of mortar.  The thick gray paste has been applied with much

enthusiasm and little skill.  Across the now dry mortar are many small

foot and handprints, the architects of these repairs certainly have left

their mark.

This segmant of the wall and those northward would seem to have little

useful defensive value if an attack on the compound were imminent.  The

ground outside of the wall to the east is scarcely visible, so close is

the dropoff to the outer wall that any more than a few men would have a

difficult time of walking side by side.  This position does offer a good,

if not far away, view of the eastern road quite a distance to the

southeast.  Perhaps more commonly viewed though would be the large

building that appears to be made out of solid gold just within the

compound proper to the west.  Its shiny golden surface nearly blinding in

full daylight and even in some moonlight.

The narrow dirt road spends most of its time winding around hillocks and

way to leave the desolate plateau for the verdant low lands.

The buildings in the compound below show that their designer was of great

Stunted tussock clumps and small oak trees have begun to overgrow the

compound.  Combined with the rubble from the wall and surrounding

E
wall~
This section of wall shows very little damage.  Perhaps in order to

breach the wall, a concentrated attack was made against the southern

sections, leaving these untouched.  Across the earthen colored stones

moss and lichen has begun to grow, adding a splash of green to the area.

Standing out in contrast to the section of the wall to the north, little

to no damage appears to have reaped upon this segmant of the ramparts. 

Small chunks of rubble are evident, sporadically tossed about on the

wall-top roadway, no doubt coming from the decimated section to the north. 

The ramparts here are still completely useable as both a defensive

position and an observation stand.  The ground just outside of the outer

wall has begun to vector outward to the road to the southeast, while to

the north the ground drops away just at the base of the wall itself.

Road perhaps is a generous term for the dirt track.  Like the rest of the

to leave this desolate place would find it a welcome alternative to

tumbling down the steep cliffs and vales of the surrounding plateau.

Extensive damage scarcely covers the description of this section of the

outer wall.  The wall is barely standing though no longer is at its full

original height.  The destruction of the wall does not appear to have

come from any war machine, nor mortal hand, instead the lack of rubble

and the totallity of the damage leads one to suspect magic was the

culprit.  The wall itself has crumbled down onto itself to stand at just

barely taller than half its original height, coupled with this the stone

wall is smoothed down to a glossy sheen and covered in a black soot.  A

slight climb to either the north or south will bring you back to the full

height of the outer walls.

The entirety of this section of the wall is covered with a dark black

appears to be wholely intact with only minor fissures appearing only at

the very top of the wall.  Staring out over the wall, only a small amount

of land is accessible on the outside of the wall, though the plateau does

widen out toward the south.  The wall-top roadway continues to both the

north and south, though the wall to the south does not appear to be safe

Heavy construction efforts are obviously underway on this section of the

outer wall.  Criss-crossing beams of repair work scaffolding stand

attached to wall by various means including generic ropes and grapples to

heavy gauged spikes driven deep into the walls surface.  A vast majority

of the early repair work appears to have been completed for the sole

reason of saving the wall from collapse, but newly completed work is

evident at the pinnacle of the ramparts...Stone pillars designed to

shield archers while they fire volley after volley into their enemies.

scaffolding rope iron~
Brave or perhaps foolhardy workers would trust their lives to the mass of

wood and rope that make up the complex scaffoldings.  The lack of forests

across the plateau would mean that the various wooden planks, some of

pine others of oak and ash would have had to been bought here from

elsewhere.  At every conceivable point the wooden frame has been lashed

with rope and supported with heavy iron spikes, driven into the stone

walls.

~
E
pillar~
Squat and functional, the architect of the pillars cared little for

beauty or grace.  The earthen-colored stone of the wall has been salvaged

to erect these protective columns.  Lavish amounts of gray mortar has

been applied to all the possible surfaces, an awful lot has been

splattered on the surrounding area.  Small footprints left in them when

wet now are permanent in the hardened mortar.

into some semblance of their former height and strength.  The dark black

rocks many cracks and fissures have been coated with dull gray mortar

allowing the salvage of most of the existing stone work.

Along the Ramparts~
The skies overhead are filled with clouds and air heavy with the musty

scent of foreboading mystery and evil that rises up from every inch of

stone and sand of the omniscent compound.  The ramparts show signs of

age, peices are chipped away and broken off.  In one place a big chunk is

missing, looking to be the result of some large artillery being shot up

here.  The wall-top path runs to the east and west here, but only east

for a few feet, until a ninety-degree turn in the path heads southward

along the eastern ramparts.

overhead skies clouds~
A blanket of gray clouds is woven into the misty sky above, pushed

sluggishly along by cold winds that blow out of the high peaks of the

northern mountains harshly down ontop the compound, creating a chilling

atmosphere.  The air here is thick and musty, heavy in the lungs, causing

a knot in the throat.

E
ramparts~
The aging ramparts extend a few feet above the ground, providing a place

to duck to avoid incoming fire, or to crouch and let loose a deadly arrow

where an enemy cant see you.  Chunks and edges are cracked, but not too

badly.  A big peice is missing in one part though, where it was hit

pretty hard by something.

Along the Ramparts~
The cold stone that makes up the floor and ramparts reflects a dull

earthen color.  The ground reflects the look of a high traffic area,

probably the result of guards rushing back and forth along the wall-tops. 

The ramparts rise up a bit higher than the height of the walkway, giving

the archers and scouts up here plenty of shielding or cover from enemies

on the outside, as well as a nice place to launch an arrow into someone's

back without them noticing you.  Looking back south into the compound,

the whole overview of it can be made out through the dense air, a whole

set of ornate buildings visible.  Not far south of here down in the

compound, a magnificient golden building looks to be a wonderful marvel

amidst a world of dark, and foreboading structures and feelings of cold

and evil.

floor earthen dull stone~
The stone floor runs underneath, and radiates the same chilling air that

surrounds in the air around the area, almost choking.  The color is a

dull gray-black, with scuffs and signs of age, results of the high

traffic of guards running back and forth.

ramparts~
Rising a few feet above the walkway atop the walls, strongly-built

ramparts provide cover for the archers to shield from incoming artillery,

or to sneak a quick arrow into the rocky fields below.

1 south ornate buildings golden~
To the south, a good overview of the complex compound inclosed within the

high walls is visible.  All the buildings are designed of great skill and

mastery in the art of architecture, and a golden building not far down on

the ground from here is probably the most elaborate of them all.

Along the Ramparts~
Looking down over the ramparts to the north, the sides of the steep rocky

plataeu falls sharply until they reach the bottom, not smoothing out one

bit.  Rocks occasionally fall from where they were lodged, rolling

swiftly down.  The ground underfoot has not seen a good washing, and has

collected dirt and grime.  Ramparts of the same earthen hue as the rest

of the compound rise up above the walkway underfoot, giving archers that

sniper advantage when picking off possible enemies.  The walltop path

continues east and west along the northern wall, and looking south, a

good overview of the entire compound is attainable.

1 north rocks plataeu~
Looking north, the ground falls sharply in a steep slope to the valley

floor, providing excellent defense against possible invasions.  Rocks

tumble down, gaining speed more and more speed as they roll.  An

occasional animal, looking from this distance to resemble a rabbit or

something along those lines, is seen scampering across the way.

ground underfoot 1 down~
Dirt and deposits from the bottom of boots litters up the floor, which

has not been cleaned in probably some time.  Grime inches its way across

the earthen floors, and a slight mildew creeps from the crevices and

cracks, resultant of the heavy, wet air.

1 south overview~
South, the entirety of the compound is visible, elegant but aging

buildings rising up from the dirt, each very unique from the other.  Far

to the south, a tower of white stands tall above anything.  While on the

northeast side, a building shines brightly, crafted of pure gold it

appears.

Guard Tower~
With its earthen-colored stone roof, this medium-sized guard tower was

designed for the sole purpose of comfort for a weary guard.  The tower is

open to all directions, the only reason to even call it a tower would be

the small roof, which stands a mere eight feet off of the surface of the

wall.  It was created to stand for many generations, with its four small

support pillars yet to still remain unseen from the ground below.  A

small covered firepit, overflowing with ashes, has been carved directly

into the side of the wall, allowing for a small amount of heat to radiate

out and still prevent light from giving away the position of anyone

warming themselves in this manner.

firepit~
A warm red glow issues forth from the tendrils of dancing flame.  The

firepit is almost completely enclosed by the stone of the wall, leaving

no light to betray the prescence of the rooftop guards to those below.  A

heap of ashes, the remnents of many fires, overflows onto the floor,

covering it with a fine coat of grey dust.

E
pillers support~
Four small, yet sturdy pillars rise up to support the dull brown stone

roof.  The designer of these columns obviously had functionality more in

mind than beauty; the pillars are rough to the touch, the dun-colored

stone only barely smoothed.  The stone is pitted and etched in places, a

token of many years of exposure to the winds and rains.

Above the Gates~
Silently flying over the walls of the compound, twin flags alert even the

casual observer to the occupants of this stronghold.  The more dominant

flag, waving slightly higher than the other, is the flag of the cult of

Morkith, the flaming eyes of the skull on the flag stare out over both

the northern road and the compound proper.  The second flag, hanging ever

so slightly lower is the flag of Temophab, the rampant black unicorn

hanging over the compound wall gives the impression that all the glory of

this stronghold is below him.

twin flags cult morkith temophab rampant black unicorn~
Nothing but the very finest materials have gone into the making of these

banners: plush velvets, fine silks, and embroidery of gold and silver

thread.  The background of the topmost flag is a midnight hue, so black

that it seems to almost absorb the light from its surroundings.  The

crimson skull of Morkith leers out from this sea of unyielding darkness,

the red and gold flames embracing the skull seeming to dance with a life

of their own.  The second flag, only slightly smaller than the first, and

hanging just a touch lower, is backed with a deep, blood-red color, and

bordered all around with golden embroidery.  Upon it, Temohpab's ebony

unicorn rear skyward, screaming defiance to all who would dare oppose his

reign.

Guard Tower~
Staring out over the ramparts, the wide mountain road to the north is

wholely visible.  This medium-sized guard tower is open to both the east

and west, though a very short distance to the west, the roadway along the

wall-tops is totally demolished.  A small roof, made from the same

earthen-colored rock as the walls offers some semblence of comfort to a

weary guard on a rainy night.  Coupled with this shelter, a small fire

pit has been cunningly crafted into the wall itself, to allow for a small

amount of heat without giving off any light to an observer on the

northern road.

road~
Like a twisting ribbon of brown, the road winds up the face of the

mountain.  The path is wide, and though the dirt is well packed by the

passage of many feet, tangled overgrowth has sprung up on both sides of

the way, making it a difficult climb.

E
firepit~
This fire pit is obviously a comfort on a cold or rainy night, with its

soft red glow of warmth.  Cunningly crafted into the wall itself, the

fire, while giving plenty of heat and light to someone in the tower, is

all but invisible from the courtyard below.

Edge of the Demolished Ramparts~
Chunks of rock lie intermingled with shards of bone and slivers of metal

that appear to be sword blades.  All three of these seem to be scorched

and melted into an altogether physical mass by what could only have been

a startingly hot fire.  No doubt the wall here used to vector in towards

the south, but instead the ramparts have been all but destroyed leaving

only a line of trees as the sole outer barrier for the compound proper. 

The wall-top road heads off towards the west, directly towards a small

guardhouse overlooking the northern compound gate.

~
[Adakar] this room pretty much matches with whats below here, as the

trees would block players view from the outer wall itself, this room

chunks rock bone shards slivers metal~
Gruesome indeed is this garbled conglomeration of rubble.  Many of the

pieces of rock look melted around the edges, granite joining with marble

in an unnatural union.  Rusty metal slivers which may once have been

bladed weapons area scattered about randomly, obviously no protection

against a disaster of the magnitude of the one which caused this hideous

burning.  Long shards of a yellowed, organic material that could only be

aged bone lie strewn haphazardly throughout the area, adding a sense of

the macabre.  Nestled against the wall, a bit of bone barely recognizable

as a hand clenches tightly to the useless hilt of a sword, rivulets of

once-molten metal dripping down across the bones.

Along the Ramparts~
Staring out over the ramparts, a stunning view is evident of a sheer drop

off the mountainside below.  At this height low lying clouds would appear

to be below a guard watching for any enemy activty, though at this side

of the compound there would be little use for guards.  The vibrant white

walls of the ivory tower to the east reach a height just a few feet

higher than the actual wall, allowing for someone on the tower's balcony

to have a view over the walls.  The rooftop road continues a very short

distance to the north and towards a staircase to the courtyard to the

south.

Along the Ramparts~
Destruction is near to complete at this point of the outer wall.  The

wall itself, to the north appears to have ran molten and literally sunk

to a height far below the rest of the wall.  Staring out over top of the

wall, a sheer drop is evident below you causing a perplexing problem of

trying to figure out what could have caused the destruction on this side

of the compound if nothing could have attacked it via normal means. 

While the rooftop road is blocked by any further progress to the north,

the way to the south seems quite clear and free of any wholesale

destruction.
